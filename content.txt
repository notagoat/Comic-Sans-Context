Barrel - Part 1

Boy: I wonder where I'll float next?

Don't we all.

Petit Trees (sketch)

'Petit' being a reference to Le Petit Prince, which I only thought about halfway through the sketch

Island (sketch)

Hello, island

Landscape (sketch)

There's a river flowing through the ocean

Blown apart

70: hey, a package!


Blown into prime factors

Irony
Narrator: When self-reference, irony, and meta-humor go too far
Narrator: A CAUTIONARY TALE
Man 1: This statement wouldn't be funny if not for irony!
Man 1: ha ha
Man 2: ha ha, I guess.
Narrator: 20,000 years later...

It's commonly known that too much perspective can be a downer.

Girl sleeping (Sketch -- 11th grade Spanish class)
I don't remember her name at all, but she fell asleep on the floor in front of me.

They are six-legged spiders

Barrel - Part 2

Boy: None of the places i floated had mommies.
Awww.

Poisson

Man: I'm a poisson distribution!
Man: Still a poisson distribution.
Hat Guy: What the hell, man.  Why do you keep saying that?
Man: Because I'm totally a poisson distribution.
Hat Guy: I'm less than zero.

Poisson distributions have no value over negative numbers

Canyon

Man 1: What time is it?
Man 2: Now.

Man 1: That's a pretty boring answer.
Man 2: Is not.
Man 2: It's the least boring answer imaginable.
They're standing at the lip of the canyon, which isn't clear at all.

Copyright

Man: Sometimes I just can't get outraged over copyright law
After reading Slashdot and BoingBoing, sometimes I have to go outside.

Just Alerting You

Man: Before you talk to me, I should warn you: I am kind of strange
Just thought you should know

Monty Python -- Enough
Character #1 : We are the knights who say... Ni!!
Two guys and a girl: hahaha
 Does anyone else find it funny that decades later, people are still groting --word-for-word-- a group loved for its mastery of shock, the unexpected and defiance of cocnvention?

Third guy: We are the knights who... Oh, God, I'm so sorry

Third guy: So sorry the car just came too fast and

Third guy: She was right there and I sasw her and then it was a blur and so much I ran to help didn't know she wasn't moving I'm so sorry ... so sorry

Third guy: Anyway, yeah, knights who say 'Ni'.

Monty Python:
Promote surreal humor.
I went to a dinner where there was a full 10 minutes of Holy Grail quotes exchanged, with no context, in lieu of conversation.  It depressed me badly.

What If

What if this isn't everything it should be?
I'm not even sure how I feel
What if I'm making a mistake?
I once made an anniversary card for my then-girlfriend with this layout.

Snapple


Right Guy: Here, take a bite of this Snapple.
Left Guy: food!

Right Guy: Ow! What is this?
<<CLINK>>
Left Guy: It's an apple infused with tin.



Sn = tin

George Clinton
Narrator: I once tried to start the urban legend that George Clinton has a B.A. in mathematics

Narrator: ...but I wanted it to be true so badly that I started believing it myself.
I still wish it were true.

Ferret

Friend: Why on earth did you make those wings? You don't seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right?
Guy: I... of course not.
Guy: That would be pretty dumb. It's just, uh... ...a Halloween costume.
Friend: oh, okay.
Friend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway?
Guy: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh?
Friend: Anyway, let's go play video games.



My brother had a ferret he loved which died since I drew this strip.  RIP.

Kepler

Person 1: Nice store. How do you keep the floors so clean?
Person 2: Oh, we hired this dude named Kepler, he's really good hard worker.  Doesn't mind the monotony. Sweeps out the same area every night.
Science joke.  You should probably just move along.

Barrel - Part 3

Boy: Wow!
A whirlpool!

T-shirts

I see dumb people
As a matter of fact the world DOES revolve around me
I can only please one person per day today is not your day.
You know what your problem is? You're stupid.
Get a clue
Do I look like a people person?
Your village called they want their idiot back
Go away
I hate you all
DIE.
Help.
Maybe if this T-shirt is witty enough, someone will finally love me.
Oh God I'm so alone
It's depressing how many of these are real shirts

Godel, Escher, Kurt Halsey
Drawn during an unending NASA lecture.


Hatless: it's just so hard to compare kids now with kids in the past. you can't help but to belong to one group or the other.

Hatless: and of course every generation seems awful to the one before it. look at quotes from throughout history.

Hatted: yeah, and it sure would be nice to have some perspective on some of this stuff. I just don't know what to make of it.


Hatless: i guess you do what you can to help the people around you and hope it turns out okay.

Hatless: in the end, what else can you do?

Hatted: lead a crusade?


it's presentism, man. the idea that historical context is irrelevant, that we understand it all

that we need take no warnings from the follies of the past. that we're facing something new.

socrates couldn't imagine the internet. but people don't change.


((The borders between the three panels on this line are cracking.))

have you seen those collections of historical pornography? talk about historical context.

did you know the first porn photo was bestial in  nature?

at least that stuff was out of the mainstream  no just in history

((the three panels have merged into one on each row.))

i don't know about you, but  I  never
even once seen









machine language translated by principles of isomorphism it is a consequence of the Church-Turing thesis that ...
but how do you select the channel you wish to se-

girls take boys away ...
never be further than a phone call and a goosebumped shiver away ...

((Back to three panels per row.))



Man: There's too much. And so little feels important.



What do you do?





I love the idea here, though of course it's not a great-quality drawing or scan.

Barrel - Part 4

Fourier

Person on phone: Hi, Dr. Elizabeth?  Yeah, uh ... I accidentally took the Fourier transform of my cat ...
Cat: Meow!
That cat has some serious periodic components

Meat Cereals

Elefino
Q: What do you get when you cross an Elephant with a Rhino?

A: I haven't a goddamn clue.

Hell if I know

Hitler
Learning about the Holocaust has really shaken my belief in God.
You know, as a young man, Hitler was rejected from art school.
Yeah... shame he didn't get in
Well, have you seen any of his paintings? They're awful. Defy all rules of composition.
What are you suggesting?
Maybe there is a god, but he's a real art lover.
This is why I don't go out in public with you.
So he's saying that God thought Hitler's art was so bad that the Holocaust was an acceptable alternative.  It's no secret that the hat guy is closely based on Aram, from Men in Hats.

Donner

Host: Donner, party of four?
Man: Actually, never mind.
Woman: We're full.
Some people haven't heard of the Donner Party.  They were pioneers who got stranded and likely resorted to cannibalism.

Barrel - Part 5






Too good not to happen.

Pillar
This one is mostly by my little brother, Doug.

Person on pillar: The sky is so blue, and all the leaves are green.
Person on ground: Haven' t you ever wondered if we really see the same colors as everyone else? It's all perception.
Person on pillar: Well, you might as well call into question all of human experience. Who really knows what world someone else sees?
Person on ground: Yeah, I guess.
Person on pillar: Anyway, can you help me down from this pole?
Person on ground: What pole?
A comic by my brother Doug, redrawn and rewritten by me

Self-reference
 Guy: I promise never to never again squeeze humor out of self-reference.

 Guy: God dammit.
I think about self-reference a lot.  Example: this comment.

Flowers
This is actually pencil on paper, just inverted and colored

Sheep
Heading: Another from my high-school notebooks.

I think it's the sheep zapping the cactus and not vice-versa

Scientists
In what scientists are calling 'pretty gay,' I can't find my shoes.
A leading expert characterized the situation as 'retarded'

Hyphen


Man: Man, that's a sweet ass-car.
I do this constantly

Apple Jacks

Father: Hey, these don't taste like apples!
Son: Fuck off, dad.
There used to be these ads, see . . .

Bowl

Boy: Sooner or later, my friend, one of us will run out of time.
For the moment it's a standoff

Light

In a dark and confusing world, you burn brightly. I never feel lost.
Like a beacon

Old Drawing

I found this in one of my high-school notebooks. I think I drew it just to take revenge on people snooping through my stuff.
Cut-down tree: WELL, YOU STUMPED ME...
I don't want to talk about it

Geico
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by threatening my agent with a golf club.

Red Spiders 2

This was actually drawn years before Red Spiders

Love

Man: I love you!
Woman: I love you!
Man: I love you more!
Woman: Yeah.

This one makes me wince every time I think about it

Schrodinger


The last panel of this comic is both funny and not funny at the same time.
Until you read it, there's no way to tell which it will end up being.
Shit.
There was no alt-text until you moused over

Secrets
I just want you to share in my secrets

and not run away
I'm a big fan of Kurt Halsey

Counter-Red Spiders

The counter-red-spider offensive begins ...
I hope we can stop them

Found

we are just two people
who found each other
No more, no less

Want
I want to be brave enough to tell you how I feel.
I want to say 'I love you' _before_ I hang up the phone for once.
I want to drive all night with you, listening to mix tapes, not caring where we end up.
Oh, and I also really want to get with your sister.
I mean, DAMN.
Well, she's pretty hot.

Penny Arcade
Tycho: You know what? If you've never played the 1995 SNES RPG 'Seiken Densetsu' don't even _bother_ reading today's strip. We don't _need_ your kind here.
Of course, Penny Arcade has already mocked themselves for this.  They don't care.

Malaria

We had a malaria party, but it turned out not to be very much fun.
The malaria party was David's idea

Secret Worlds


'Everybody has a secret world inside of them.
All of the people in the whole world
I mean everybody
No matter how dull and boring they are on the outside
Inside they've all got unimaginable
magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing, worlds
Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe.'
--Neil Gaiman
SandmanNo two adjacent circles are the same color.

Hobby

When the police bust drug hideouts, I sneak in and hide. Then I jump out and startle them into shooting me so they lose points.

The only one of these games I really played was Area 51

It works, bitches.
Bonus points if you can identify the science in question

Useless
[[Different mathematic equations, all with heart on left side, and all equal question mark. Equations are as follows:
Square root of heart equals question mark
Cosinus of heart equals question mark
Derivative of heart with respect to x  equals question mark
Identity matrix of heart equals question mark
Fourier transform of heart equals question mark]]
My normal approach is useless here
Even the identity matrix doesn't work normally

The Cure

Caption: Robert Smith should do a cover of Coldplay's 'Clocks,' so when he sings 'Am I part of the cure
 or am I part of the disease?' we can say, 'Ooh, we know this one!'
My first try at drawing a real face in years

Wait For Me

Woman: Why didn't you wait for me?
Man: I thought you were gone forever!
Woman: I said I'd be back in a minute!
Man: The . . . the seconds went fast at first, but then they started to drag on. She was there for me.
Woman: You had an affair in the 90 seconds I was gone?!
Man: . . . yes.
Man: And we had a son.
Man: He'd be about your age now.
Opening dialogue by Scott

Why Do You Love Me?

Man: Why do you love me?
Woman: I don't know; My heart never gave me a choice.
Man: Aww.

Woman: I wish it had.

Graduation

blonde: What do you want to do when you graduate ?
brunette: I want to become a lighthouse operator.
blonde: Oh ?
brunette: Yeah.

brunette: Lighthouses are built on interesting pieces of coast, so I'll have an interesting place to walk and swim, and great views of all kinds of weather.  I'd feel good about myself and my work every single day.

brunette: I'd get to be the girl in the tower, only I'd be the one rescuing people.
brunette: Why. What do you want to do ?
blonde: I'm going to grad school.  I don't really know why.
brunette: Wanna come hang in my lighthouse over breaks ?
blonde: ...yeah.
Opening dialogue by Scott

Super Bowl

My hobby:
While everyone is watching
the Super Bowl, feeling
smugly superior because
they're 'Only watching for
the ads,' I steal cars.The Super Bowl is actually an elaborate ruse, concocted by a shadowy group in the mid sixties for this purpose.  The 'watch it for the ads' addition was a master stroke.

Stacey's Dad
Stacey's Dad: Look, I know you think that since I walked out she could use a guy like you. But trust me. That woman has a lot going on, and you want none of it.
Stacey's Dad: Get out while you still can.
I bet she gets you to mow the lawn, doesn't she?

Valentine - Karnaugh

You make me feel so
much it all runs together
I wish I could tell you

So few words
for so many feelings
crisscrossing my heart

A matrix of desire
Tangled relations
I can't simplify

I wish I could find
the Karnaugh map
for love.
Love and circuit analysis, hand in hand at last.

Valentine - Heart
I want to wish you a happy Valentine's Day but unless this card is going to finally get you naked, I have to admit my heart's not really in it.
Just pretend you're kidding.

Solar Plexus

Hat guy: Asolarplexussayswhat?
Man: What?



It hurts to be hit there, you know

Banter

First Guy: Man, she's hot
Second Guy: Whatever, you are so gay.
First Guy: C'mon, everyone knows you're the gay one
Second Guy: Hey, your mom's pretty masculine, but sleeping with her doesn't make me gay.
First Guy: Fag.
Second Guy: Ass pirate.
First Guy: Fudge packer
Second Guy: Cock jockey
First Guy: Cum dumpster.
(silent panel)
First guy: Okay, seriously, are you gay? Because if you've been holding out on me, we're missing out.
Second guy: No, it's cool.
First guy: OK me neither.

This was an actual mock conversation between me and a friend at TGiF.  The waitress walked up around panel 5 and was somewhat put off.

Pillow Talk
Guy: Staring at the ceiling, she asked me what I was thinking about.
Guy: I should have made something up.
Guy: The Bellman-Ford algorithm makes terrible pillow talk.
Maybe I should've tried Wexler?

Guitar Hero

When I'm in a rock band, I'm gonna do a cool, mellow song. Then in the middle I'll stop, announce 'this part is just to be an asshole to people playing Guitar Hero,' and then flail wildly on the strings for 30 seconds.
And then do it again in a moment now that they're out of Star Power

In the Trees

Man: We made it so far together but then I lost you in the trees.

Man: Finally
It was tricky.

Classhole

Man 1: How did you spend your morning?
Man 2: Feeding rocks to children in the park.
Man 1: Your sociopathic abuse of random strangers staggers me.
Man 2: I aspire to have more creativity than the common asshole.
Man 2: I'm more of a classy asshole -- A class-hole, if you will. For example, I like poking tiny holes in styrofoam noodle cups at the grocery store--
Man 2: Thanks to me, someone gets surprise boiling water in the lap.
Man 1: I am in awe.
Man 2: It's even more fun to do to condoms.

Curse Levels

Random Guy: What a gosh-darned cunt.
I find so much fun in language.

Familiar

Woman: I worry that I'm just with you because it's familiar. Of course no one else compares. I've known you for so long that I'd have to spend years with someone to build up this kind of connection
and I daren't let you go of you long enough to let that happen.
Woman: But I guess this is really all I can ask for.
I'm happy with you; I should stop worrying.

Man: This is probably a bad time to bring this up, but I don't actually like you.
:(

Bored with the Internet

First man: I feel like I'm wasting my life on the internet. Let's walk around the world.
Man with the black hat: Sounds good.



First man: And yet all I can think is, 'This will make for a great LiveJournal entry.'
I used to do this all the time.

Iambic Pentameter
Person 1: What time can you pick Michael up?
Person 2: Well, I can meet the plane at ten of six.
Person 1: Do you know where to find him?
Person 2: I'll meet him at the stairs before the gate.

Of course, you don't wanna limit yourself to the strict forms of the meter.  That could get pretty difficult.

Katamari

Girl: Can you pause for a moment and help me with something?
Man: You know, our love is like a katamari.  We travel along, rolling up more and more of the world into our shared experience, taking it and making it our own.
Girl: I, you... wow.  Geekiness aside, that was actually incredibly sweet.
Man: The clutter of everyday life, with a simple core to tie it together, eventually becomes something grand as the world itself.

Girl: Okay, also sweet, but now I'm wondering if you could possibly get any gayer.
As the King of All Cosmos remarked, 'Is it that it's fun, or that it lets you forget yourself?'

National Language
This happened to my friend:

Man: English should be the national language. These immigrants should have to learn English when they come here.
Woman: Yeah
Man: When you go to live somewhere, you learn the language they speak there. English is the language of the land.
Other Woman: Excuse me, but osio Sarah dawado.
Man: What the hell was that?
Other Woman: Woman: Cherokee.
She's pretty sharp when provoked.

Digital Rights Management

Hat Guy: Dear Sony, Microsoft, the MPAA, the RIAA, and Apple: Let's make a deal. You stop trying to tell me where, when, and how I play my movies and music, and I won't crush your homes under my inexorably advancing wall of ice.
If you're interested in the subject, Lawrence Lessig's 'Free Culture' is pretty good

Velociraptors

High bathroom window: probably secure.
Outer door: secure.
picture window: VELOCIRAPTOR ENTRY POINT!
Narrator: It's been over a decade since Jurassic Park opened, and I still size up buildings for their potential as shelter against velociraptor attacks.
You're probably thinking, 'has it been a decade?'  It's been over thirteen years, buddy.

Escher Bracelet


The only downside is that it would be a little uncomfortable

Gravitational Mass
Hat Guy: Gravitational mass is identical to inertial mass. That is, the amount of inertia something has and the amount of gravity it has are effectively the same. What's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be any reason this should be true. One could imagine an extremely large object with lots of resistance to force and no gravity (or vice versa), but this is never observed.
Hat Guy: You know what? I'm just gonna skip the rest of the buildup and say it: Yo mama's fat.
She's so fat the attraction goes up as the CUBE of the distance instead of the square

Jacket

First man: Where's my fucking jacket?

Second man: Over there, next to your regular one.
First man: My what?
Second man: Never mind.
We have this conversation at least once a day in my apartment

Pwned

Welcome to text-only Counterstrike.
You are in a dark, outdoor map.
> GO NORTH
You have been pwned by a grue.I'm sure a discussion of the reason for the disappearance of adventure games in favor of RPGs would be fascinating

Sunrise

Guy's thoughts: I love the time just before sunrise. It's quiet; no one is ever just walking about. It's like a secret. I always hope that I'll find someone else quietly hiding from sleep, and we'll see each other and sit and talk. I guess this is a bad place to meet people. I wish it weren't.


Sometimes, I sit on top of parking decks and watch the sun rise.  I feel like I should have a guitar or something.

Back to the Future


Man: This weekend, my professor friend built a time machine out of a DeLorean and I went back in time! I helped make sure my parents got together and helped my dad to be less of a loser.
Woman: Wow! Do you still have the time machine?
Man: Nah. But I did what I really needed to do.
Woman: Uh huh.

Woman: Okay, you remember that my father was in the WTC North Tower, right?
Man: Yeah...why?
Woman: I...nothing.
He's kind of an asshole, when you think about it

Moral Relativity

Related to moral relativism, it states that ethics become subjective only when you approach the speed of light.  That is, it's okay to be self-serving, steal, and murder as long as you're going really, really fast.
(Note:  This is why rap sounds better on the highway at 90 mph)
It's science!

Find You

You were afraid that you would disappear, that you would be lost and forgotten.
I held you tight against the dark and said that I would always come for you.
Then one day it happened. You were torn from my arms and vanished from this world.
Maybe you don't remember my promise. But I meant every word.
I hope you're not afraid, wherever you are.
You don't need to be.
I'm not.
I will find you.

Person 1: Sweet. I summoned myself from a parallel universe.
Person 2: You know, he could vanish at any moment.
Person 2: You should take this chance to make out with yourself.
Person 2: . . . you know, _I_ could vanish at any moment.
It's possible.  Better to be on the safe side.

Wright Brothers

Man: I've heard that when the Wright brothers argued, they periodically switched sides in the debate to try to encourage a more balanced conclusion.
Man: We should try that in our relationship!
Woman: It's a neat idea, but I think treating personal issues like a debate will only engender hostility and hurt feelings.
Man: No, I think it would help, by forcing us to consider the other person's point of view.
Woman: Hmm, maybe you're right.
Man: Am not.  It's a bad idea.
I'm not sure if this is actually true

Snakes on a Plane! 2

Top of the poster: From the creators of last summer's hit thriller Snakes On a Plane comes:
Superimposed on the sky and planes:  Snakes...  on EVERY Plane!
Bottom of the poster: Much worse than last time.
James suggested this, and I have to agree.  It'd be much worse.

M.C. Hammer Slide

A: I just feel like somewhere out there is the girl for me.
B: Yeah.
A: Someone loving and caring.
B: I know what you mean.
A: A girl whose only mode of transportation is the M.C. Hammer Slide.
B: Yeah.
B: ...Wait, what?



Once, long ago, I saw this girl go by.  I didn't stop and talk to her, and I've regretted it ever since.

Riemann-Zeta

Comment: You are like the prime numbers. Unpredictable turns, unconstrainable. Tantalizingly regular but never quite the same. I am like the Riemann-zeta function. A rippled curtain of the imagined and real. Deeply tied with you in ways incomprehensible. Although, strictly speaking, The Riemann-zeta function couldn't have given your herpes.

Computational Linguists

Hat Guy: And the dumbest thing about emo kids is that... I... You know, I'm sick of easy targets. Anyone can make fun of emo kids. You know who's had it too easy? Computational Linguists. 'Ooh, look at me! My field is so ill-defined, I can subscribe to any of dozens of contradictory models and still be taken seriously!'
Chomskyists, generative linguists, and Ryan North, your days are numbered.

Meerkat

You have to admit--there's no rule on the books saying a meerkat can't play rugby.
Gorilla, yes.  Adorable golden retriever, yes.  But it says nothing about meerkats.

City

Shadowed city slumber silently. A second-story suite.
Come craving courtship, selected serendipitously
Crazed copulations, a salacious storm  of continuous coitus.
Spread, straddled, conquered.
Countless crashed suitors strewn carelessly.
Centre, silken sheets sensuously caressing soft skin,
Contentedly sleeps your mom.God, she's such a whore.

Pong
 So what do we do if video game AI opponents become smart enough to question the 'Matrix' into which we've put them?
 Wait a minute! None of this is real! I can see through the world! I can see the code! I AM THE ONE!




Following this, the pong paddle went on a mission to destroy Atari headquarters and, due to a mixup, found himself inside the game The Matrix Reloaded.  Boy, was THAT ever hard to explain to him.

Dating Service

Randall: Hi, my name is Randall. I like candlelight dinners and long walks on the beach.
Randall: When I say long walks on the beach, I mean LONG walks on the beach. I've met people through these services who CLAIM to like long walks on the beach. But we'll be out there barely an hour before they start in with 'I'm tired' and 'Don't you think it's time we head back?'

Quirky Girls

Man: I love that girl.  She's not afraid to be quirky and different.
Woman: You know, I'm active in street theatre and I collect and paint Asian dolls.
Man: ...Okay, I didn't actually mean be different.  I just want silly and entertaining on command now and then.
Romantic comedy heroines, I'm talking to you.

Centrifugal Force

Hat Guy: Do you like my centrifuge, Mister Bond? When I throw the lever, you will feel centrifugal force crush every bone in your body.
Mr. Bond: You mean centripetal force. There's no such thing as centrifugal force.
Hat Guy: A laughable claim, Mister Bond, perpetuated by overzealous teachers of science. Simply construct Newton's laws into a rotating system and you will see a centrifugal force term appear as plain as day.
Mr. Bond: Come now, do you really expect me to do coordinate substitution in my head while strapped to a centrifuge?
Hat Guy: No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.
You spin me right round, baby, right round, in a manner depriving me of an inertial reference frame.  Baby.

Marketing Interview

Guy behind the desk: I've heard you're one of the best in marketing business, but I've got your portfolio here and looks like you've never run a major campaign. Why should I hire you to head our new initiative?
Guy with a hat: If you don't mind asking, what gave you the idea I was one of the best in the business?
Guy behind the desk: Hm? I don't remember. Just word of mouth or someth-- ...oh, you're good.
Guy with a hat: Thank you. When can I start?
There are a lot of books on marketing out there.  I wonder if you're safest just buying the most popular one.

The Fast and the Furious
On the other side of the world, a new style of street racing rules the Tokyo underground. The cars are lighter, the tires are slick. When you drift, if you ain't out of control, you ain't in control. And if you work the wheel back and forth just right,

you get blue sparks.

Sometimes when I steer shopping carts around corners, I slide them a little and pretend I'm getting the blue spark boost.

Fans

<<click click>>
Narrator: Best thing about having my own apartment: Holding fans in place so they twitch helplessly and make that clicking sound without my mom yelling at me.
It's not going to break the fan, bouncing a rubber ball off the wall isn't going to dent it, and the roof can hold me just fine.  You LIED!

Music Knowledge

Female: What kind of music do you listen to?
Male: Oh, a mix of things. Some classic rock like Boston, but then of course Queen and Bowie, Joan Jett...
Female: Definitely, we need more of those sounds.
Male: But there's some great newer stuff too, like Franz Ferdinand, The Donnas, and Audioslave.
Female: Sometimes they're a little much for me. I go more for things like The Arcade Fire, sometimes mixing some electronic sounds like Postal Service.
Male: Oh yeahÃ¢ÂÂhave you ever checked out Freezepop?
Female: Mhm! Synth pop can be fun, but at the same time, I agree that sometimes you just need to blast some Metallica.
Male: Who?
Female: ...Metallica.
Male: Are they new?
Narrator: I sound pretty knowledgeable about music until people figure out that I'm just naming bands from Guitar Hero.
When Guitar Hero 2 comes out I'll have fresh conversational material for MONTHS.

1. The velociraptor spots you 40 meters away and attacks, accelerateing at 4 m
s^2 to its top speed of 25 m
s. When it spots you, you begin to flee, quickly reaching yourtop speed of 6 m
s. How far can you get before you're caught and devoured?
2. You're at the center of a 20m equilateral triangle with a raptor at each corner. The top raptor has a wounded leg and is limited to a top speed of 10 m
s.

The raptors will run toward you. At what angle should you run to maximize the time you stay alive?
3. Raptors can open doors, but they are slowed by them. Using the floor plan on the next page, plot a route through the building, assuming raptors take 5 minutes to open the first door and halve the time for each subsequent door. Remember, raptors run at 10 m
s and they do not know fear.

Dreams

A: You should be more careful what you write. Future employers might read it.
B: When did we forget our dreams?
A: What?
]
B: The infinite possibilities each day holds should stagger the mind. The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox. We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out before us. We see the same things every day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.
B: And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.
B: This is very important, so I want to say it as clearly as I can:
B: FUCK.
B: THAT.
B: SHIT.
In Connor's second thesis it is stated 'There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.'  Does the routine destroy our creativity or do we lose creativity and fall into the routine?  Anyway, who's up for a road trip!

A Way So Familiar
Person 1: I saw a cute girl outside the bank today. She looked nice.
Person 2: Oh no, not again. You are the _worst_ judge of these things.
Person 1: But she was so sweet. Shy, but there was something in her eyes. A pain down in her soul, the same as the one down in mine.
Person 2: Mm hmm.
Person 1: The police light played through her mohawk like the sun setting through pine trees as she shoveled the third hooker into the trunk of the camry...
Person 2: Back up.

Professor: Well, evidence suggests that they were not.
Girl: But he--

Professor: A million people can call the mountains a fiction, yet it need not trouble you as you stand atop them.

Girl: But he believes the silliest things!
Professor: So?
Professor: The universe doesn't care what you _believe_. The wonderful thing about science is that it doesn't ask for your faith, it just asks for your eyes.
Girl: But he's a US Senator!
Professor: Ah, then yes, we do have a bit of a situation.
Scientists are also sexy, let's not forget that.

Six Months

Guy: It's been six months and I still have those dreams where you're pressed tight against me, where you look into my eyes and give me that grin and it's like you've forgotten everything.
Guy: And something in the back of my head says it's wrong, it's not like this anymore, but I push it down.  In the morning, I tell myself I can't control my dreams, but there's a part of me that doesn't want them to stop.
Guy: And honestly, waking up would be a lot easier if your mom didn't look so much like you.
Guy: There's always that moment of confusion.
But then she does that thing with her tongue and I remember why I left you.

Penny Arcade Parody

Gabe: What? Sony has plenty of launch titles lined up that aren't lame sequels.
Tycho: Name one. And furthermore, they... I... uh...


Narrator: I can't do this. I can't parody Penny Arcade. I've got nothing on t hose guys. They're a class act, they know their audience, they know exactly what they're doing. Gabe experiments with his art, always bold and fresh without trying to perform. Tycho's writing continues to astound day after day. I can just see him, reading my uncultured swill masquerading as his florid prose.

Narrator: But he's not angry, no. He's sitting at his desk smiling that condescending half-smile, the corner of his mouth belying the self-assurance of a writer who never misplaces a word. His firm hands rest easily on the keyboard, his right thumb caressing the space bar gently, as I enter the room. He knows I'm there without turning around, and I'm too nervous to speak. But I don't have to; he understands, I can see it in the way his eyes play over me, reading my fears and doubts in a glance and washing them away with a knowing smile. Then he's on his feet, he's in front of me, and I don't feel the electric jolt I expected as our hands meet. It's just warm, warm and right: As I sink into his eyes I feel a hand on my shoulder, and I see Tycho smile at someone behind me. Gabe is standing there, grinning that mischievous grin, and twirling his beloved cardboard tube between his fingers.
Narrator: The night has just begun.

No one show this to Tycho's wife, okay?

Angular Momentum

Man on bed: What are you doing?
Girl: Spinning counterclockwise
Each turn robs the planet of angular momentum
Slowing its spin by the tiniest bit
Lengthening the night, pushing back the dawn
Giving me a little more time here

With reasonable assumptions about latitude and body shape, how much time might she gain them?  Note: whatever the answer, sunrise always comes too soon. (Also, is it worth it if she throws up?)

Donald Knuth

No-Hat Programmer: Man, you're being inconsistent with your array indices.  Some are from one, some are from zero.
Black-Hat Programmer: Different tasks call for different conventions.  To quote Stanford algorithm's expert Donald Knuth, 'Who are you?  How did you get in my house?'
No-Hat Programmer: Wait, what?
Black-Hat Programmer: Well, that's what he said when I asked him about it.
His books were kinda intimidating; rappelling down through his skylight seemed like the best option.

Playing Devil's Advocate to Win
Man: Yes, from the evidence it looks pretty likely to me that we're causing global warming on a horrific scale.  But with science you don't need to argue.  It doesn't matter who wins the debate -- it's about reality.  By just waiting a little longer, we'll get to SEE who was right.  It feels unethical but I find myself wanting to keep quiet about the science just to know for sure.  As terrible as it sounds, the state of the world isn't really my responsibility.  I'm just thrilled to get to watch.  If the scientists are right -- and if we keep people from understanding just a little longer -- we'll enjoy quite a ride.  And pragmatically, on the outside chance that they're all wrong, I get saved the embarrassment of having spoken up.
There are so many well-meaning conservatives around here who just assume global warming is only presented as a moral issue for political reasons.

Turn Signals

Person in Street: Hey, our turn signals are in sync!
Person in Car: What the hell?
Person in Street: Usually they're at least a little off. But I've been watching like 30 seconds and haven't seen any beat frequency!
Person in Car: Who are you?
Person in Street: You know, from the beat frequency you can tell the difference in timing of the two signals.
Person in Car: ...
Person in Street: But ours are the same!
Person in Car: ...
Person in Street: So, wanna hang out later?
I'm not very good at meeting people.

Misusing Slang
Narrator: The best part of getting older is gonna be intentionally misusing slang around teenagers just to watch them squirm.
Man: Oh man, that song is so pwned!
Adolescent: <<twitch>>
It slowly dawns on us that our parents knew exactly what they were doing.

Nihilism


MAN: There is no God. Our existence is without purpose.
MAN IN BERET: Oh, definitely.
MAN IN BERET: We are adrift in an uncaring void indifferent to all our mortal toil.
MAN: Exactly! In the end, nothing we do matters.
MAN IN BERET:  Totally.
MAN: We just... Why are you climbing that tree?

MAN IN BERET: Because the future is an adventure! Come on!
MAN: But--
MAN IN BERET: Hey! I found squirrels!Why can't you have normal existential angst like all the other boys?

Reverse Euphemisms
My Hobby:  Reverse Euphemisms

Person 1: Oh, hey, school just let out and it's YMCA night, so I've gotta go take a shit.
Person 2: What?
Person 1: I mean I actually have to drop the kids off at the pool.
I'm still waiting for a chance to use 'I have to see a man about a horse'.

Words that End in GRY

Random Guy: There are three words in the English language that end in 'gry'. 'Angry' and 'Hungry' are two. What's the third?
Hat Guy: I don't think there is one, unless you cound really obscure words.
Random Guy: Ha! It's 'language'! I said there are three words in 'the English--'

Random Guy: What th-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Hat Guy: Ok, listen carefully.
Random Guy: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Hat Guy: Communicating badly then acting smug when you're misunderstood is not cleverness.
Random Guy: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hat Guy: I hope we've learned something today.
Random Guy: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The fifth panel also applies to postmodernists.

Turn Back
Person 1: Should we keep going?
Person 2: I don't know.
Person 1: We can turn back if you want.
Person 2: Look--
Person 2: Did it ever occur to you that maybe I don't have a plan any more than you?  Maybe just having this conversation means we're lost.

Person 1: Kind of scary.
Person 2: It's terrifying.
Person 1: This place is beautiful.
Person 2: Yeah.
I hear that these days Bill Watterson is happy just painting in the Ohio woods with his father and doesn't get any mail or talk to anyone.

String Theory
String Theory summarized:
I just had an awesome idea. Suppose all matter and energy is made of tiny, vibrating 'strings'.
Okay. What would that imply?
I dunno.
This works on pretty much every level.

Skateboarding is Not a Crime

When I'm president, skateboarding will still be legal, but display of those stupid stickers will be a felony.
'Arrest me, I'm a skateboarder' is an even more obnoxious variant.

Movie Seating
At the movies, I get frustrated when we file into our row haphazardly, ignoring the computationally difficulty problem of seating people together for maximum enjoyment.
 Single line: friends. Double line: in a relationship. Arrow: one-way crush. Dashed line: acquaintances
 Guys! This is not socially optimal!
It's like the traveling salesman problem, but the endpoints are different and you can't ask your friends for help because they're sitting three seats down.

That's What SHE Said

Person 1: He doubts she could've done they claimed she did.
Person 2: That's what _SHE_ said!
Yes, I mean she said that during sex.  Yes, it was a little weird.

Automatic Doors
When I walk past an automatic door and it opens for me, I worry that if I don't go in I'll hurt its feelings.
<<whirrrr>>
Figure: Oh, um, I'm sorry, I was just ... um ... I guess I can hang out for a bit.I hope no automatic doors I know read this.  I would be so embarrassed.

Before Sunrise

Man: Every morning for a week now I've gone out driving before sunrise.
I wanted to get lost in the dark, park my car, listen to music, and sip from a warm drink as dawn broke around me, gradually revealing a landscape I'd never before seen.  A chain of unique beinnings forcing wonder into the seeds of each day.
But I guess I need more willpower, because each sunrise just found me at your mom's apartment again.
It's an amazing time of day; the light is great for photography.

Alice and Bob

Girl: I'm sure you've heard all about this sordid affair in those gossipy cryptographic protocol specs with those busybodies Schneier and Rivest, always taking Alice's side, always labeling me the attacker.
Girl: Yes, it's true.  I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages.  But does anyone realize how much it hurt?
Girl: He said it was nothing, but everything from the public-key authenticated signatures on the files to the lipstick heart smeared on the disk screamed 'Alice.'
Girl: I didn't want to believe.  Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack.  But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself.

Girl: So before you so quickly label me a third party to the communication, just remember: I loved him first.  We had something and she tore it away.  She's the attacker, not me. - Not eve.
Yet one more reason I'm barred from speaking at crypto conferences.

Not Really Into Pokemon
I have found the perfect phrase for condescendingly dismissing anything:

Man without hat: Have you seen the new ubuntu release?
Man with black hat: Nah, I'm not really into PokÃ©mon.
As of this writing, Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0 have left my computer a complete mess.

OTHER: OKAY.
EXPLAINER: AND e^(ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ(-1))=-1.
OTHER: NOW YOU'RE JUST FUCKING WITH ME.
I have never been totally satisfied by the explanations for why e to the ix gives a sinusoidal wave.

Canada

First Man: If we lose this election, I'm moving to Canada.
Second Man: You say that every year.
First Man: I mean it this time.
Second Man: Well, becoming a citizen takes work.  Meanwhile, you have no money, half an art degree, and it's the start of winter.  You'll freeze to death in the streets.
First Man: Whatever.

Second Man: No, don't you get it?  If you die in Canada, you die in REAL LIFE!
IT'S ALL REAL

Boy: I heard about it on the interblag!
Sometimes I hate the internet.  Sometimes it makes me happy that 'The Tubes' has become slang for the internet so quickly.

Nash

First Man: Hey, Dr. Nash, I think those gals over there are eyeing us.  This is like your Nash Equilibrium, right?  One of them is hot, but we should each flirt with one of her less-desirable friends.  Otherwise we risk coming on too strong to the hot one and just driving the group off.
Second Man (Dr. Nash): Well, that's not really the sort of situation I wrote about.  Once we're with the ugly ones, there's no incentive for one of us not to try to switch to the hot one.  It's not a stable equilibrium.
First Man: Crap, forget it.  Looks like all three are leaving with one guy.

Second Man (Dr. Nash): Dammit, Feynman!
Maybe someday science will get over its giant collective crush on Richard Feynman.  But I doubt it!

Snacktime Rules
My dad was always the one who taught me about science, but looking back, I'm starting to realize how much my nerdiness was influenced by my mom.

Child: Mom, can I have a snack in my room before bed?
Mom: No, Dear. You know you only get that privilege when your age is one less than a multiple of three.
I am not making this rule up.  Although my mom wants you all to know it made perfect sense at the time.

The Familiar

Person standing up: Let's go see sunrise over the ocean.
Person at computer: That's a long drive, it's cold, I'm tired, and rationalizing the familiar is easy.

When I say we should do something sometime, I'm secretly hoping you'll say 'Why not now?'

Reload

Leader: Okay men, we're going in. Stay low, keep behind cover, and if you run out of ammunition, shoot outside the battlefield to reload.
And watch out for that guy from comic #53.

Exercise
Like many geeks, I got a lot more interested in exercise once I made the connection to leveling up.

Man doing pull-ups: One more point to str, then I'll run to work on con.
I haven't had the patience for RPGs in a long time.

IPoD

Character 1: You see, statisticians communicate using IPoD -- IP over Demographics. For example, the header of the next packet I send will be encoded into the New Jersey death rate.
Character 2: So you're going to hack the census bureau and change the number of reported deaths?
Character 1: Guess again.
Character 1: Hey, have you seen my crossbow?
For smaller numbers he has to SAVE lives.  The birthrate channel is even more of a mixed bag.

Lojban

Working for Google
Have you read about Google HQ? It sounds like an incredible place to work.
Man, I ain't going to be chained down in no corporate idea factory! They think just 'cause they've got a nice building and laid back culture, I'm gonna want to come in all day long and work on fascinating problems with the smartest people in the world.

So, what, they turned you down?
I don't understand it! I even baked them a cake shaped like the internet!
I hear once you've worked there for 256 days they teach you the secret of levitation.

The Perfect Sound

Person 1: I'm telling you, listen right here to the sets of rising notes following the opening section.
Person 2: Uh huh.

Person 1: And then right here, the transition into the chorus. _This_ is music. This is _art_!

Stereo: Oh Mickey, you so fine, you so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey! *clap* *clap* Hey Mickey!
Person 2: There's something wrong with you.
Oh, what a pity, can't you understand . . .

Penises

Woman: They are about this big.

Now can we PLEASE, as a culture, move on?
The penis varies in size when flaccid and is pretty consistently about yea big when erect.  Anyway, back to the sitcom one-liners and the constant flow of spam.

Command Line Fu

Man 2: Last night I was watching videos with this girl and my monitors kept turning off - even though I had disabled power save.
Man 1: Odd.
Man 2: However!  I wrote a command to jiggle the mouse pointer every couple minutes to keep it from going idle.
Man 1: Not the first hack I'd try, but see?  Linux has problems, but it gives you the tools to deal with them - and save your date!
Man 2: Actually, I was half an hour into the pointer scripting documentation when she got dressed and left.

Perspective
Narrator: Sometimes, when I first wake up, I am caught in the horrible grip of perspective.

Person: It may be a jewel of open source, but Firefox is JUST A BROWSER. It shows WEBPAGES. What the hell is WRONG with us?
Narrator: Fortunately, this subsides quickly.
I wonder what I was dreaming to prompt that.  I hope it wasn't the Richard Stallman Cirque de Soleil thing again.

Right-Hand Rule

Alternatives to the Right-Hand Rule in vector multiplication:

Book Rule: Open the front cover along the first vector and the back cover along the second. The result vector is along the spine, out the top.

Handgun Rule: Point the grip along the first vector and rotate it so that the second vector is on the safety latch side. Fire. The result vector is toward the bullet holes.

Body Rule (males only): Point your right arm along the first vector and your legs along the second, then watch some porn.
To really expand your mind try some noncartesian porn.  Edwin Abbot Abbott has nothing on 'Girls on Girls in Tightly Closed Nonorientable Spaces'.

Candy Button Paper
When it came to eating strips of candy buttons, there were two main strategies.  Some kids carefully removed each bead, checking closely for paper residue before eating.
Others tore the candy off haphazardly, swallowing large scraps of paper as they ate.
Then there were the lonely few of us who moved back and forth on the strip, eating rows of beads here and there, pretending we were Turing machines.

Romantic Drama Equation
TV Romantic Drama Equation
(Derived during a series of 'Queer as Folk' episodes)
[[A table shows equations for possible romantic pairings in a TV show. The equation under 'gay' is n(n-1)
2+x(x-n); the equation under 'straight' is x(n-x).]]
x: Number of male (or female) cast members.
n: total number of cast members.
[[A graph plots pairings (for large casts) against cast makeup. Each of the above equations forms a curve.
'Gay cast' starts high for an all male cast, dips down at 50
50 cast makeup, and then rises again for all female.
'Straight cast' starts at zero for an all male cast, peaks at 50
50 cast makeup, and then drops to zero again for an all female cast.
The two curves intersect at two points close to the middle.]]

Real-life prospective-pairing curves over things like age can get depressing.

Hat Guy: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that e^pi-pi was a standard test of floating-point handlers--it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors.

First Girl: No. I'm happy to grow up. But I won't pretend fun things aren't still fun out of fear of looking silly.
Second Girl: But you're 24 and building blanket forts. How have you changed? What's adult about that?
First Girl: Well, there's my boyfriend curled up in the back.

Speaker: Last night I drifted off while reading a Lisp book.

Speaker: Suddenly, I was bathed in a suffusion of blue.

Speaker: At once, just like they said, I felt a great enlightenment.  I saw the naked structure of Lisp code unfold before me.
Stick Figure Man: My God
Stick Figure Man: It's full of 'car's
Speaker: The patterns and metapatterns danced.  Syntax faded, and I swam in the purity of quantified conception.  Of ideas manifest.
Truly, this was the language from which the gods wrought the Universe.

God: No, it's not.
Stick Figure Man: It's not?

Ninja 2: Let's do Eric S. Raymond next.
Ninja 1: Or Linus Torvalds. I hear he sleeps with nunchucks.
Later we'll dress up like Big Oil thugs and jump Ralph Nader.

Swingset

Woman: You know, at the peak of a big swing, you become weightless.


Boy: Hey guys. Come check this out.
Someone bring me a pocket fan so I can drift around the yard.

Color Codes

Man with phone: Hey, what's your cell number?
Man at desk: (Violet Brown Gray) - Uh, I mean, (718)-387-6962.
Man with phone: Okay, you are putting down those resistors and going outside for a while.
Man at desk: That's probably a good idea.
(It's the TMBG Dial-a-Song line, to save you some time.)

Resonance

<<clatter clatter>>

Person 1: Excuse me--you're jiggling your leg up and down. It's traveling through the floor and making my desk resonate.
Person 2: Oh, I didn't even realize! I'll stop.

Person 1: Actually, can you just shift the frequency up by 15%? I think you can get resonance with Steve's desk instead.
Person 2: Uh huh . . .
Person 1: Here are the calculations. Let's coordinate and try to spill his drink.
It's really hard to control the frequency, actually.

Graffiti

'This graffitii is
fleeting human contact
both of us lost,

Hamiltonian

Lecturer: And therefore, based on the existence of a Hamiltonian path, we can prove that the routing algorithm gives the optimal result in all cases.
Man: Oh my God.

(Out of frame): What? What is it?
Man: A sudden rush of perspective. What am I doing here? Life is so much bigger than this!


Man: I have to go.





Woman: Ohh...

Man (out of frame): Wait a moment.
Woman (out of frame): What is it?

Man (out of frame): His proof only holds if there's a Hamiltonian _cycle_ as well as a path!
Woman (out of frame): ...excuse me?
Man (out of frame): Paper, I need some paper.
Man (out of frame): Hey, do you mind if I jot down some notes on your chest?
The problem with perspective is that it's bidirectional.

Cat Proximity






Man: You're a kitty!
Yes you are!  And you're sitting there!  Hi, kitty!

Chess Enlightenment
Narrator: Why is chess so hard? Maybe the answers lie within me. Maybe I just need to let go, relax, and let my instincts and subconscious speak.
<<Meditate>>
Narrator's Subconscious: Knight to G-4

Narrator: That's not even a legal move.
Narrator's Subconscious: Okay, hold on. How do the pawns capture, again?
Narrator: Man, Obi-Wan was full of crap.
You know that 'sweep the pieces off the board and see it in your mind' thing?  Doesn't work.

A New CAPTCHA Approach

 Yes
 No

Escape Artist

Standing Man: I was fascinated by locks as a kid. I loved how they turned information and patterns into physical strength.
Sitting Man: Why does my script keep dying?

Standing Man: And a lock invites you to try and open it. It's the hacker instinct. Only your ignorance stands in the way.
Sitting Man: Wait it's passing bad strings.

Standing Man: I admired Harry Houdini, how he could open any lock and free himself from any restraint.
Sitting Man: Ah - Bash is parsing the spaces.
Standing Man: Sure some of it was fakery and showmanship. But I still wonder how he so consistently escaped handcuffs.
Sitting Man: Backslashes
Standing Man: Huh?
Sitting Man: Never mind.
Easier to escape: n-layered nested quotes or an iron maiden?

Kite








Man's thought bubble: Hey, there's someone else up here.  I wonder what her story is.

Man's thought bubble: Maybe I should say hi.

It's easy to regret your awkward conversations but hard to regret the ones you didn't have.

Collecting Double-Takes

MY HOBBY:  Standing in the supermarket's produce section holding a tube of K-Y Jelly, looking contemplative.

Keyboards are Disgusting


Chat: Wanna see an optical illusion? Hold your keyboard up in front of you and look at the home row.

Chat: Now cross your eyes a little so the 'g' and 'h' overlap.
Chat: Keeping focus, lift the keyboard over your head.


Man: Eww!
Chat: HahaAlternate method: convince them to pretend it's an Etch-a-Sketch and try to erase it.

Pet Peeve #114


Voice on the phone: Really?  What are you doing reading?  It's Saturday night!
I'm reading a goddamn book, thank you very much.

Blagofaire
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Hey, it worked!
Man: What? Who are you?
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: I'm from the distant future.
Man: Wow.  Hi!
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Are you a blogger?  I play one of you at our festivals!
Man: Huh?
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Like the ren faires of your time - I do reenactments.
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: We relive the days when the internet was new and free.  The days of risky sharing, slashdot, the myspace music renaissance.  The generation's finest minds meeting on comment threads, battling roving bands of trolls, and holding the great dialogues of the age!
Man: Is that how you -
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: We're fuzzy on some details.  Did bloggers really wear red capes and goggles and blog from high-altitude balloons?
Man: No!
Man: Well, Cory Doctorow does.  But nobody else.
Things were better before the Structuring and the Levels.

Dream Girl
Man 1: I had a dream that I met a girl in a dying world.
It was all coming apart. Hairline cracks in reality widened to yawning chasms. Everything was going dark and light all at once, and there was a sound like breaking waves rising into a piercing scream at the edge of hearing. I knew we didn't have long together.
She grabbed me and spoke a stream of numbers into my ear. Then it all went away.

I woke up. The memory of the apocalypse faded to mere fancy, but the numbers burned bright in my mind. I wrote them down right away.

They were coordinates. A place and a time, neither one too far away.
Man 1: What else could I do? When the day came, I went to the spot and waited.
Man 2: ...and?
Man 1: It turns out wanting something doesn't make it real.
No matter how elaborately you fool yourself.

Battle Room

Dink: Sorry, Ender - seems like there were some system crashes.  The battle's gotta be cut short.
Ender: The lasers still work.
Dink: Yeah, but the enemy's gate is down.
Bean actually sabotaged it just to give Dink the excuse to make that joke.

Tabletop Roleplaying

DM: Your party enters the tavern.
Player: I gather everyone around a table. I have the elves start whittling dice and get out some parchment for character sheets.
DM: Hey, no recursing.
I may have also tossed one of a pair of teleportation rings into the ocean, with interesting results.

Floor Tiles

First: Why are you walking funny?

Second, thinking: Well, my instinct is to step only on black tiles, but they're too far apart. So I'm letting myself walk on the tiles directly in line with the black ones, but that means that when we walk diagonally, I have to step in a pattern where...

Second: I'm not walking funny.
The worst part is when sidewalk cracks are out-of-sync with your natural stride.

Labyrinth Puzzle

Man with hat: And over here we have the labyrinth guards.  One always lies, one always tells the truth, and one stabs people who ask tricky questions.
And the whole setup is just a trap to capture escaping logicians.  None of the doors actually lead out.

Factoring the Time

Man at desk: 253 is 11x23
Man at computer: What?
Man at desk: I'm factoring the time.
Man at desk: I have nothing to do, so I'm trying to calculate the prime factors of the time each minute before it changes.
Man at desk: It was easy when I started at 1:00, but with each hour the number gets bigger
Man at desk: I wonder how long I can keep up.
 <<beep>>
Man at desk: Hey!
Man at computer: Think fast.
I occasionally do this with mile markers on the highway.

Hypotheticals
Beret Guy: What if I had some ice cream? Wouldn't that be awesome?
Person: No, stop--
Beret Guy (thinking):
        Person: Great, you've trapped us in a a hypothetical situation!
        Beret Guy (holding ice cream): Mm, ice cream.
        Person: Maybe if I had a knife I could cut our way free . . .
        Person (thinking):
                Beret Guy: Mmm, ice cream!
                Person (reaching back into previous thought bubble): Here, take this one.
What if someone broke out of a hypothetical situation in your room right now?

Chess Photo

Friend 1: What are you doing?
Friend 2: Gluing down chess pieces.
Friend 1: Why?
Friend 2: Because there's a picture I've always wanted... I'll need your coat to sneak this onto the ride.

We once tried playing blindfold chess on the Aerosmith ride at Disney World.

Snopes
Another urban legend? You should check out Snopes before sending me this stuff.
Oops; yeah.
Man, Snopes is really great--independent fact-checkers trawling our collective discourse, filtering out misinformation.
Yeah, but they have their dark side. The couple that runs snopes.com also runs a network of spam servers that start many of those forwarded stories in the first place, ensuring they'll always have business.
That's absurd. Plus, it's definitely not true--it was debunked by...
Yes?

Escalators
Graph with y axis titled 'Urge to try running up the down escalator', with 'weak' by the bottom and 'strong' by the top. x axis has every two years labeled and every year signified by a smaller mark, which stops at 24. A red line with 'What I was supposed to feel' with points at every line rises, peaks at 7 years old, then falls 'tangent graph' shaped until the end. Along this line are shown various stick-figures at 12, 14, 20 and 24. A second red line runs 'What I've actually felt' which stays consistently high.
The one time I tried, I got hit by a slinky going down at double speed.

Comic Fragment
Editor's Note: Mr. Monroe has been missing for several days.  We have received no submissions from him for some time, but we found this single panel on his desk in a folder labeled 'MY BEST IDEA EVER' .  It is clearly part of a work in progress, but we have decided to post it in lieu of a complete comic.

As the damaged space station fell deeper into the atmosphere and started to break up around her, Janeane Garafolo tightened her grip on the motorcycle.
The volcano was looming ahead, and her tranquilizer pistol only had six darts left - barely enough to bring down even ONE tyrannosaur.
No one wants an explanation more than us.  Except Ms. Garofalo.

Subjectivity
[tall slide, seen from the ground]
When I was a kid, my school playground had a really tall slide that always made me nervous
[tall slide, seen from the side]
We moved away, but the slide stuck in my memory, becoming a skyscraping monster
[car and a sign pointing to school zone]
Years later, I was passing through my old town and remembered the playground
I drove to the school to see the slide that my inner six-year-old thought was so towering
[huge slide, (small) person beside it]
AND IT WAS HUGE
I KNEW IT
Or maybe the slide is like Aslan, and gets taller as I do (except without the feeling of discomfort when I reach my teens and suddenly get the Christ stuff.)

Man 2: For added security, after we encrypt the data stream, we send it through our Navajo code talker.
Man 3: ...Is he just using Navajo words for 'Zero' and 'One'?
Man 2: Woah, hey, keep your voice down!
As far as I can tell, Navajo doesn't have a common word for 'zero'.  do-neh-lini means 'neutral'.

Conspiracy Theories

The official story of 9-11 is full of holes.  Take the --

Please, stop, because seeing this happen to you breaks my heart.

Conspiracy theories represent a known glitch in human reasoning.  The theories are of course occasionally true, but their truth is completely uncorrelated with the believer's certainty.  For some reason, sometimes when people think they've uncovered a lie, they raise confirmation bias to an art form.  They cut context away from facts and arguments and assemble them into reassuring litanies.  And over and over I've argued helplessly with smart people consumed by theories they were sure were irrefutable, theories that in the end proved complete fictions.
Young-Earth Creationists, the Moon Landing people, the Perpetual Motion subculture -- can't you see you're falling into the same pattern?

You don't seriously believe we landed on the moon.  Do you?


Dear God.

YES MY CHILD?

I would like to file a bug report.There are a lot of graduate-educated young-earth creationists.

General: As I expected. This is a foolish move by Mussolini, but like Hitler he will no doubt force his commanders to --
Messenger: Hey. Godwin's Law.
General: Dammit.
General: You know, this may become a problem.

Constantly stopping these briefings halfway through is becoming a pain.

Certainty

Teacher 1: My students drew me into another political argument.
Teacher 2: Eh; it happens.
Teacher 1: Lately, political debates bother me. They just show how good smart people are at rationalizing.

Teacher 1: The world is so complicated - the more I learn, the less clear anything gets. There are too many ideas and arguments to pick and choose from. How can I trust myself to know the truth about anything?
And if everything I know is so shaky, what on Earth am I doing teaching?
Teacher 2: I guess you just do your best. No one can impart perfect universal truths to their students.
Teacher 3: <<ahem>>
Teacher 2: ...Except math teachers.
Teacher 3: Thank you.

Wait, this is space -- how are you talking to me?  And, as an afterthought, what's up with the hole in reality?

Choices: Part 4

Clone: I shouldn't do this, but I pulled you out for a moment to give you a hint.
Girl: A hint?
Clone: Take wrong turns.  Talk to strangers.  Open unmarked doors.  And if you see a group of people in a field, go find out what they're doing.  Do things without always knowing how they'll turn out.
Girl: Why tell me this?
Clone: You're curious and smart and bored, and all you see is the choice between working hard and slacking off.  There are so many adventures that you miss because you're waiting to think of a plan.  To find them, look for tiny interesting choices.  And remember that you are always making up the future as you go.
Girl: So, wait, what *is* this place?  Am I going to wake up thinking this was a dream?
Clone: This is... think of this as after the game, outside the theatre.  To go in, I had to suspend disbelief, forget the outside.
Girl: So you... Huh.  Why give me hints I'm going to forget?
Clone: You'll forget this trip but I think the hints should stay with you.
Girl: ...if this is a game, are you--are *we*--cheating?

TCMP

First guy: Hey, help me test the Transconsciousness Messaging Protocol.
Second guy: What's that?
First guy: I've been training myself to keep my fingers moving slightly as I fall asleep, so I can type from inside dreams.

First guy: I'm going to sleep now. My computer will relay my messages to you as I explore the dream world.

First guy: So strange to think none of this is real. And yet I have this lifeline to the internet back home.
First guy: A chance to speak from one reality to another. I feel like Bell & Watson. I get to write the inaugural TCMP message. Let's see...

Girl: 'F1rst pÃ¸st!!'?
Second guy: Great. He's jumped straight to transreality trolling.
A big obstacle in experimenting with the mind's dream-simulation-engine is holding onto the details as you wake up.  With TCMP you can bring back any information you want.

Merlin

Woman: I'm bad at goodbyes. At some level I never think they're for real.
Man: They make me think of T. H. White's Merlin.
Woman: Oh?
Man: He lived backwards, remembering the future and not the past. To him, final goodbyes meant nothing, while first hellos were tearful and bittersweet.
Woman: Huh - so over the years he'd forget all his friends.
Must've been lonely.
Man: Yeah. He ended up just sitting around at home watching DVDs all day. The best was the time he rented 'Memento'...

Merlin: Well, that was straightforward.
I mean, the black-and-white stuff was running backward, but it hardly mattered to the story.

Electromagnetic Spectrum
((Everything is one big panel.))

The Electromagnetic Spectrum

These waves travel through the electromagnetic field. They were formerly carried by the aether, which was decommissioned in 1897 due to budget cuts.

Other waves:
- Slinky waves
- Sound waves
- The wave

[[Three parallel scales are across the bottom. The first is lambda (m), ranging from 100Mm to 100fm; second is f (Hz), which starts at 1 Hz and reaches 100 THz about 2
3 of the way along, after which the labels read 'other entertaining greek prefixes like peta- exa- and zappa-'; last is Q (Gal^2
Coloumb), whose labels are 17, 117, pi, 17, 42, theta, e^pi-pi, -2, 540^50, and 11^2. Above the scales and lined up accurately with the first two are the following:]]

- Power & Telephone (100Mm to 1km)
- Radio & TV (1km to somewhere between 1m and 10cm); above that are many boxes showing subranges (AM, VHF, UHF, 14
7 NPR pledge drives, a very thin band for the space rays controlling Steve Ballmer, 99.3 'The Fox,' 101.5 'The Badger,' 106.3 'The Frightened Squirrel,' cell phone cancer rays, CIA, ham radio, kosher radio, shouting car dealership commercials)
- Microwaves (a bit more than 10cm to a bit more than 1mm); it also has subranges (aliens, just below SETI, wifi, FHF, brain waves, sulawesi, gravity)
- Toasters (about 1mm to about 100 micrometers)
- IR (about 100 micrometers to somewhere between 1 micrometer and 1 nm); above that is a bell graph labeled 'Superman's heat vision,' with a motorcycle driving up the left side labeled 'Jack Black's Heat Vision.'
- Visible light (and, under it, visible dark); above that is a bell graph labeled 'sunlight.' There's a breakout chart above it showing the visible spectrum from 700nm (red) to 450nm (violet). There's an arrow pointing to where octarine would be, somewhere off to the side. Above that are bars showing the absorption spectra for hyrogen, helium, Depends(R) (yellow only) and Tampax(R) (red only).
- UV (about 100nm to about 10nm)
- Miller Light (a thin bar around 10nm)
- An unlabeled section with a thin line above it showing the frequency of the main death star laser
- A blocked-off portion labeled 'Censored Under Patriot Act.'
- X-rays (from about 1nm to about 10pm); a line above shows the frequency of mail-order x-ray glasses. Somewhere vaguely above the 10pm mark is a potato.
- Gamma
cosmic rays (10pm and smaller); above that is a bar marked Sinister Google Projects which also trails off into higher frequencies, and blogorays, which are slightly lower.

Sometimes I try to picture what everything would look like if the whole spectrum were compressed into the visible spectrum.  Also sometimes I try to picture your sister naked.

Long Light

Man: This light always takes forever.  I'd like to smack the idiot who designed this intersection.

Engineer: Hi.
Man: Who the hell are you?
Engineer: I designed this intersection.
Engineer  : You're right - I should have just made the light shorter! Never mind the hours of simulation and testing I did.  Never mind that this intersection interacts with it's neighbors in a complicated way and it took me a week to work out timing sequences that avoided total jams.
Engineer: Clearly, I'm a crappy engineer and you have a better solution.  Go on, show me your proposed timings.
Man: Get the hell off my hood before I start driving and fling you into traffic.
Engineer: You can't.  Light's red.
Man: Well, when will it change?
Engineer: Tuesday.
You can look at practically any part of anything manmade around you and think 'some engineer was frustrated while designing this.'  It's a little human connection.

Standing man: Sure Ã¢ÂÂ Mussolini made the trains run on thyme.
Man at Computer: ...
Man at Computer: We are no longer friends.
I have nothing to apologize for.

Projection

Woman: Argh, movie pet peeve. Someone sitting at a computer in the dark with the screen projected on their face. Monitors don't work like that!

Man: Right - that only happens if you're in the way of a proected image. Like when we're sitting together in a parked car in the rain and the mottled light through the raindrops on the windshield makes shifting shadows on your skin...

Woman: ...I wasn't really into the movie anyway.
Man: The nearest rainstorm's about 60 miles away.
Woman: We'll drive fast.
Man: I'll grab some snacks.
Out in a field, not another car for miles, silence but for the rain drumming on the sunroof, warm thick folds of the blanket hiding wordless fingertip games ...

Tape Measure

Man: Hey, a tape measure!

<<extend>> <<extend>>

<<clatter>>

<<extend>>
Man: Eight feet!  I wonder if that's a world record?

Audience:  Go!  Go!  Gooooo!This sequence was later reproduced in the International Tape-Extending Federation archives, retitled 'The Founding of the Sport'.

Alone
[[Girl crawling on bed toward boy

Narrator: It's not something you can turn off.

Narrator: A part of me is always detached.
 Abstracting, looking at numbers and patterns.

Narrator: When we should be closest, part of me is still alone.
 Counting the touches of her fingertips.
 Touch.
 Touch.
 Touch touch.
 Touch touch touch.
 Touch touch touch touch touch.

Narrator: Wait.
 Is that...
 That's the Fibonacci Sequence!
 Whatever I did to deserve you, it couldn't have been enough.
Worries assuaged, the numbers become less important than your touches.

Fucking Blue Shells
My Profanity Usage By Cause:






You can evade blue shells in Double Dash, but it is deep magic.

Man: Hello, 911?  I just tried to toast some bread, and the toaster grew an arm and stabbed me in the face!
911: Did you read the toaster's man page first?
Man: Well, no, but all I wanted was--
911: <<click>>
Life is too short for man pages, but occasionally much too short without them.

Bookstore

Man: This book looks interesting. Maybe I'll buy it.

Man: Oops, I read the whole thing.
Man: I'll just quietly put it back and go.

<<BEEP BEEP BEEP>>
Voice from off-frame: Hey! Your brain set off the sensor!

Lisp Cycles

Guy: Lisp is over half a century old and it still has this perfect, timeless air about it.
Guy: I wonder if the cycles will continue forever.
Guy: A few coders from each new generation rediscovering the Lisp arts.

Tesla Coil

No hat: I finally finished my Tesla Coil!

Hat Man: Cool, but-
Hat Man: Check *this* out


No Hat: How did you do that?
Hat Man: The world doesn't actually make any sense. Science doesn't work. No one told you because you're so cute when you get into something.
Hat Man:  Still, neat toy.
No Hat:  Now you're hovering!
Hat Man: I guess you're still not getting this.
For scientists, this can be the hardest thing about dreams.

Aeris Dies

First Man: Maggie's gone. You can't bring her back.
Second Man: But I have to, she's a part of my life.
First Man: <<sigh>>
First Man: Okay, let me put this in your terms.
First Man: Remember when Aeris died in FFVII? It was sad, but you had to keep playing.
Second Man: Actually, I downloaded a mod to add her back to my party. It changed other character's appearances and dialogue to hers so you didn't have to lose her.
Second Man: Lots of gamers did it.

First Man: That is troubling on several levels.
Second Man: I wonder if Maggie's old dress would fit you.
It's bad enough that all the families in your Sims are just you and Maggie recreated over and over.

Facebook


Boy: Favorite bands? Hmm...
Boy: Maybe Regina Spektor or the Polyphonic Spree.
Girl: Whoa, those are two of my favorites, too!
Girl: Clearly, we should have sex.
Boy: Okay!  My favorite position is the retrograde wheelbarrow.
Girl:  Ohmygod, mine too!

Names

Man (thinking): I hate it when I don't know someone's name, but it's been long enough that it's too awkward to ask.

Minister: Do you Rachel, take this man...
Man (thinking): Aha! Rachel!
I'm always so happy that I successfully navigated the introduction that I completely forget to pay attention to the name the other person told me.

Nighttime Stories

For a few weeks now, sometime past midnight, a girl has wandered past my apartment reading by flashlight.

I wonder why she's up so late.
Maybe she's restless
Like me.
I wonder what story she's wrapped up in.
I wonder if she let's anyone into that island of light.



Man: Hi!  What are you reading?
Girl: Orson Scott Card's 'Xenocide.'  It's my favorite in the series!

Man: Wait, you like it more than Speaker for the Dead OR Ender's Game?
Girl: Yeah!


And to think I loved her.
Cue angry letters from all seven fans of Xenocide.

Rule 34

Male: HuhÃ¢ÂÂThomas the Tank Engine slash fiction.
Female: It's rule 34 of the internet. If you can imagine it, there is porn of it.
Male: Nah. The web is freaky, but it can't begin to have everything.
Male: There's no porn set atop storm-chasing vans. No homoerotic spelling bees. No women playing electric guitar in the shower.
Female: Actually, that last one would look pretty hot. As long as they were unplugged or waterproofed...
Female: Rivulets of water run down her chest, the smooth body of the guitar firm against her hips.
Female: She twangs the E-string and it shakes off tiny droplets in all directions.

Female: You're sure it doesn't exist?
Male: Not yet.
Female: I'm registering WetRiffs.com. Let's get on this.
Okay, Lance.  For entry into the college bowl, spell 'Throbbing'

Orphaned Projects

First voice: Problem: One of the volunteer developers has a date this weekend. Dates lead to romance, romance leads to orphaned projects.
Second voice: What's the plan?
First voice: We're hiring him a relationship coach. He's like Will Smith in 'Hitch,' but he only gives bad advice.

Man in black hat: Okay, remember: The key to conversation is constructive criticism.
Man in black hat: You need to show you're smart enough to solve her problems.
Man in front of mirror: Makes sense.
His date works for Red Hat, who hired a coach for her, too.  He advised her to 'rent lots of movies like Hitch.  Guys love those.'

Excessive Quotation

Woman: It's strange to stare at the moon and think about people walking on it.
Man: That's no moon, it's aÃ¢ÂÂ<<gack>>

GIRL: Fuck those people.  Wanna have an adventure?

Shopping Teams

Bad: Two non-nerds
First man: Let's get that one.
Second man: okay.
Good: non-nerd + nerd
Woman: Let's get that one.
Man: Wait, I think that one might be a better deal.
Woman: Okay, that one.
Very Bad: Two Nerds
Man: How about that one?
Second man: i think the other one might be the better deal...
First man: Hmm, I'm not sure...'
Two Hours Later

Man: I think our main problem is our unclear definition of value
Woman: That is not your main problem!
I am never going out to buy an air conditioner with my sysadmin again.

Commitment

Narrator: I understand now. There's no choir of angels when you meet the right person. It's about growing out of your fears to realize what you have is what you want.
Guy: I do.
Girl: I do.

Girl 2: Hi.
Narrator: Well, shit.
Could be worse.  The last guy in that situation fell for one of the transient trumpeting angels.

Action Movies

Man: Another summer gone without a mindless big-budget action movie.
Woman: Huh? Die Hard was nothing BUT action!
Man: No, it was too talky.
Woman: What? Too talky?
Man: I tallied it minute-by-minute. It's at least 60% people walking and talking. ALL those movies are.
Man: Just once, I want a real action movie. 30 seconds of exposition followed by a perfect 90-minute action scene. One with a huge budget, a good choreographer, and a great director.
Woman: And they should center it around some character we already know, someone we never get tired of watching.
Man: I think we've got something here...

Movie Poster: Coming this summer
Movie Poster: River Tam
Movie Poster: Beats up EVERYONE

By my count, only 48 of the 158 minutes in Live Free or Die Hard have action.  That's pathetic, guys.  Crank is better, but needs a bigger budget and more Summer Glau.

With Apologies to Robert Frost
A God's Lament
Some said the world should be in Perl;
Some said in Lisp.
Now, having given both a whirl,
I held with those who favored Perl.
But I fear we passed to men
A disappointing founding myth,
And should we write it all again,
I'd end it with
A close-paren.Some say the world will end in fire; some say in segfaults.

Insomnia

Lying awake at night
I realize how many little lights there are in my room.
The alarm clock is the brightest.
Can't sleep
I'm alone with those glowing red numbers

Time slows
Does time even exist here?
Thoughts churning in on themselves

The madness can't be far away
Ah yes

There it is.
Crap, I have levitation class at 25:131.  Better set the alarm to 'cinnamon'.

Dating Pools

Woman: This sucks. The median first marriage age is 26. The pools of singles is shrinking. I'm running our of time.
Man: Actually, not quite.
Man: Yes, older singles are rarer. But as you get older, the dateable age range gets wider. An 18-year-old's range is 16-22, whereas a 30-year-old's might be more like 22-46.

Text on chart: Standard creepiness rule: Don't date under (Age
2 + 7)
Man: I did some analysis of this with the Census Bureau numbers just last weekend. Your dating pool actually GROWS until middle age. So don't fret so much!

Woman: Did you analysis say anything about the dating prospects of people who spend weekends at home making graphs?
Man: Come on. Somewhere at the edge of the bell curve is the girl for me.
The full analysis is of course much more complicated, but I can't stay to talk about it because I have a date.

Braille
I learned to read braille a while back, and I've noticed that the messages on signs don't always match the regular text.

Man's thoughts: S-i-g-h-t-e-d-P-e-o-p-l-e-S-u-c-k ... Hey!
The only big difference I've seen is in colors.  Where the regular text reads 'press red button', the braille reads 'press two-inch button'.

Loud Sex

Narrator: My neighbor has loud sex.
<<OHHHHH>>
<<GASP>>
<<AAAAAAA>>
Narrator: Good for her and all, but it keeps me up at night.

Neighbor: Sorry, could you hear us last night? Oh, you know how it gets sometimes.
Narrator: (small) Not really...

Narrator: But tonight I finally get my revenge. Because now I have a loud girlfriend too.

Narrator: And an elliptical reflector dish.

Spherical or parabolic reflectors would of course lead to aberrant behavior.

That Lovin' Feelin'

Man: You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips and there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips.

Man: Maybe I should try your sister instead.
Maybe there's no tenderness in her fingertips either, but at least SHE puts out.

Nostalgia
Narrator: This generation is going to have some weird nostalgia.

Male Figure: Darling, let's put on our best fake accounts, connect to the core ForumSpace, and trick people into looking at a picture of a man's distended anus!
Female Figure: Oh, it'll be just like old times!
If you don't get this one, don't google it.

Engineering Hubris

Maybe engineering is the pursuit of an unattainable perfection.
Maybe it's impossible to create something bug-free.
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe the tyranny of Murphy is the penalty for hubris.
But I just can't shake the feeling

With all those supplies
_I_ could have caught that roadrunner.
Chuck Jones is a vengeful god.

28-Hour Day


First man: You have trouble sleeping right?
Second man: Only when your mom is over.

First man: Since your work is flexible-
Second Man: -Like your mom-
First Man: -you should try the 28-hour day - 20 awake, 8 asleep (or 19
9 if you prefer).
Second Man: I prefer your mom.
First Man: It synchs up with the week - you spend weekdays awake normally, then on weekends you can go out all night.
Second Man: Just like your mom.
First Man: It means four extra hours daily. You can stay up until you're exhausted every day and then spend a full 9 hours asleep each night!
Second Man: But how much time can I spend doing your mom?
First Man: You? I'm guessing three or four minutes, tops.
Second Man: ...Well played.
Small print: this schedule will eventually drive one stark raving mad.

Thighs

Guy: It's the thigh of the tiger
Guy: When the moon hits your thigh like a big pizza pie, that's amore.
Guy: She's my brown-thighed girl.
Girl: Don't you have a job or something?
Girl: Also, Eww.
My thighs have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord?

Pix Plz

Man: Hi.  I'm here about the girl who visited your IRC channel last night looking for Java help.
Nerd: What did you do to my door?
Man: When someone with a feminine username joins your community and you say 'OMG a woman on the Internet' and 'jokingly' ask for naked pics, you are being an asshole.  You are not being ironic.  You are not cracking everybody up.  You are the number one reason women are so rare on the Internet.
Man: At least, the parts of it _you_ frequent.

Man: As someone who likes nerdy girls, I do not appreciate this.  I'm here to ban you from the Internet.  The gal behind me with the EMP cannon is Joanna -- she'll be assigned to you for the next year.  Try to go online and she'll melt your PC.
Nerd: Dude, she's hot.  Is she single?
Man: Joanna, fire.
But one of the regulars in the channel is a girl!

Ballmer Peak


Presenter: Called the Ballmer Peak, it was discovered by Microsoft in the 80's. The cause is unknown but somehow a B.A.C between 0.129% and 0.138% confers superhuman programming ability.
Presenter: However, it's a delicate effect requiring careful calibration--you can't just give a team of coders a year's supply of whiskey and tell them to get cracking.
Man in public: ...Has that ever happened.
Presenter: Remember Windows ME?
Man: I knew it!
Apple uses automated schnapps IVs.

Tapping

Man: Hey, I can get different pitches by tapping on different parts of the desk.

Man: Sweet, I can do the Jurassic park theme!


Friend: So, what did you do all afternoon?
Man: Hung out.
Sometimes the best fun looks like boredom.

A-Minus-Minus

woman: What are you doing?
the Hat Guy: Making the world a weirder place.
bobcat: <<mrrowlll>>

man: Starting with my eBay feedback page.

screen: comments:

You can do this one in every 30 times and still have 97% positive feedback.

Effect an Effect
Narrator: MY HOBBY:
Using the more obscure meanings of 'affect' and 'effect' to try to trip up amateur grammar nazis.
Man : I think that our foreign policy effects the situation.
Computer : You mean 'affects'.

Time to paint another grammarian silhouette on the side of the desktop.

Exploits of a Mom

Phone: Hi, this is your son's school. We're having some computer trouble.
Mom: Oh dearÃ¢ÂÂdid he break something?
Phone: In a wayÃ¢ÂÂ
Phone: Did you really name your son 'Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--' ?
Mom: Oh, yes. Little Bobby Tables, we call him.

Mom: And I hope you've learned to sanitize your database inputs.
Her daughter is named Help I'm trapped in a driver's license factory.

Eggs

Man: So, how do you like your eggs in the morning?
Woman: Ooh, sunny side up.
Man: Oh. Huh.
Woman: Is that a problem?
Man: Well, it's just that I was trying to set you up for the 'unfertilised' line.
Woman: Ah. Bad timing; I'm actually looking for casual sex. ...interested?
Man: I'd love to, but I've got like 20 more jokes to set up tonight. Hey, have you seen a priest and a rabbi?
Oh, yeah, we get tons of them at these casual sex bars.

Turing Test

TURING TEST EXTRA CREDIT: CONVINCE THE EXAMINER THAT HE'S A COMPUTER.
Man: You know, you make some really good points. I'm ... not even sure who I am anymore.
Hit Turing right in the test-ees.

Indecision
First Guy: So, what do you want to do?
Second Guy: Still no ideas.
First guy: Wait, I think there's a rule about this.

[[The book of Rules is opened to the following:
RULE social.b.99.1
If friends spend more than 60 minutes unable to decide what to do, they must default to sexual experimentation.]]

First Guy: Huh.
Second Guy: I did not know that rule.
First Guy: Me neither.
Second Guy: I'll go get the Crisco.
Hey, I don't make the rules.  It's in the book.

Photoshops

Text: My hobby: Insisting that real-life objects are photoshopped.
Woman: This sabre is a 19th-century family heirloom.
Man: It looks photoshopped.
Woman: Huh?
Man: Yeah, the reflections are all wrong. Definitely photoshopped.
When I look into your eyes, I see JPEG artifacts.  I can tell by the pixels that we're wrong for each other.

Gyroscopes

Narrator: Despite years of studying physics, I still find gyroscopes a little freaky.



Gyroscope: Greetings, Human.
{{title text: We didn't actually land on the moon -- it just looked like we did because of precession.  Also, gyroscopes caused 9
11.}}We didn't actually land on the moon -- it just looked like we did because of precession.  Also, gyroscopes caused 9/11.

Getting Out of Hand

Wikipedia's role as brain-extension, while a little troubling, is also really cool.

Wasteland

I am alone in this wasteland, a thousand miles  from you.
But I haven't forgotten the feel of your skin, your mischievous smile.
You'd think a thousand miles would be enough.
I guess I'll keep walking.
You make forgetting look so easy.

Mattress

Cuddling face-to-face is nice, but we can never figure out where to put our lower arms.
Our solution: the Cuddle Mattress!
Your lower arms fit in the convenient gap.




Listener: Oh man, that's ALWAYS bothered me.
Listener: I want one.

Listener: Although ... so the lower arms just sort of dangle?
Listener: What do you do with them?

Man: It was a bit awkward.
Clicker: <<click>>
Woman: Then we had a second breakthrough.

Priorities

Teacher: If you don't turn in at least one homework assignment, you'll fail this class.

Student: Yeah. But if I can fail this class, the grades on my report card will be in alphabetical order!
You should start giving out 'E's so I can spell FACADE or DEFACED.

Post Office Showdown
I spend a lot of time mentally choreographing elaborate fight scenes with strangers around me.

Man's thoughts: Okay - if that old man pulls a crossbow,
Man's thoughts: I'll throw the postal scale at him and dive backward behind the stamps machine.
Man's thoughts: But what if the lady by the door has a katana in that box?
Man's thoughts: Better set my iPod to the 'Kill Bill' fight theme, just in case.
That track ('Battle Without Honor or Humanity') -- like 'Ride of the Valkyries' -- improves *any* activity.

Future

Voice #1: Come explore the future with me!



Voice #2: I can't.
But the past was much too cramped!

 Our shadows taller than our soul

 To be a rock and not to rooooll

1337: Part 1

Man 1: You're not on the neighbour's WiFi, are you?
Man 2: Yeah, why?
Man 1: The admin... plays games.
Man 2: No problem. I'll just hop on a secure VPN.
Man 2: Whoa, my connections are dying as soon as I start to tunnel anything!
Message on laptop: A VPN? How cute! And stop trying to SSH.
Man 2: Holy shit! Someone's inserting notes into the pages I request! Editing the TCP stream live!
Man 2: Nobody's that fast. Who is this admin?

Mrs. Roberts: My goodness. Neighbourhood scamps on the wireless.
<<taptaptaptap>>
Man 1: I should have warned you about Mrs. Roberts.
Man 2: How does she type with oven mitts!?
Man 1: You've been pwned pretty hard, man. You might want to sit down.
If you're not cool enough to do it manually, you can look up tools like Upside-Down-Ternet for playing games with people on your wifi.

1337: Part 2

Man 2: So the greatest hacker of our era is a cookie-baking mom?
Man 1: Second-greatest.
Man 2: Oh?
Man 1 (Narrating) : Mrs. Roberts had two children. Her son, Bobby, was never much for computers, but her daughter Elaine took to them like a ring in the bell.
Man 1 (Narrating) : When Elaine turned 11, her mother sent her to train under Donald Knuth in his mountain hideaway.
Man 1 (Narrating) : For four years she studied algorithms.
Knuth: Child -
Knuth: Why is A* search wrong in this situation?
<<swish>>
Elaine: Memory usage!
Knuth: What would you use?
Elaine: Dijkstra's algorithm!
Man 1 (Narrating) : Until one day she bested her master
Knuth: So our lower bound here is 0(n log n)
Elaine:  Nope. Got it in 0(n log (log n))
Man 1 (Narrating) : And left.
Trivia: Elaine is actually her middle name.

Narrator: IT WAS THE LATE 90'S. ELAINE CRISSCROSSED THE COUNTRY WITH ADRIAN LAMO, THE 'HOMELESS HACKER', LEARNING TO GAIN ENTRY INTO SYSTEMS BOTH VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL.]]
Adrian Lamo: SO YOU JUST THROW A RUG OVER THE FENCE AND ... SAY, WHAT IS THIS PLACE ANYWAY?
Roberts: NOWHERE SPECIAL.
Lamo: ...ELAINE, IS THIS NSA HEADQUARTERS?
Roberts: ...LOOK, I JUST WANT TO SEE IF THEY'VE BROKEN RSA.

Narrator: SHE LEARNED, FROM LAWRENCE LESSIG, ABOUT THE MONSTROSITY THAT IS U.S. COPYRIGHT LAW.
Roberts: SO, HOW DO WE FIX THE SYSTEM?  STAB BAD GUYS?
Lessig: I'M STARTING SOMETHING CALLED 'CREATIVE COMMONS'
<<SHINK>>
Elaine Roberts: I THINK WE SHOULD STAB BAD GUYS...

Narrator: SHE MET WITH STEVE JOBS TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF APPLE.
Roberts: COMPRESSION AND BANDWIDTH ARE CHANGING EVERYTHING.
Jobs: WHO ARE YOU?  IT'S 3:00AM!
Roberts: APPLE SHOULD MAKE A PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYER.
Jobs: I'M CALLING THE POLICE.
Roberts: HEY, IDEA - INTEGRATE IT WITH A CELL PHONE!
I once asked an NSA guy whether they'd broken RSA.  And I know I can trust him, because I asked if he was lying to me and he said no.

1337: Part 4
As time passed, Elaine intensified her hacking work, anonymously publishing exploit after exploit.

To crack open proprietary hardware, she teamed up with one of the top experts in signal processing and data transferring protocols.

Elaine: Hi, mom.
Mrs. Roberts (Elaine's mom): Hello, dear. Did you have fun?
They were an unstoppable team.

Elaine: I finished the CSS decryptor.
Mrs. Roberts: Good, dear. I'll send it along to Jon.
And were eventually noticed.

RIAA man: Game's over.
MPAA man: You're coming with us.

Elaine: Oh, are we?

Mrs. Roberts: Now now, Elaine -

Mrs. Roberts: Don't let them provoke you, dear.

RIAA Man: Ah, so you haven't read the DMCA.
MPAA Man: Title IV, Section 408: Authorization of Deadly Force.
: Hark!


Bearded man: Cease this affront to freedom, or stand and defend yourselves!
MPAA Man: Stallman!
Mrs. Roberts would have gotten up sooner, of course, but she was busy piping find ~ and find ~nomad into xargs shred, just in case.

1337: Part 5

Elaine: Thanks, Stallman!
Stallman: 'Tis my pleasure.
Elaine: So, wait - how did you know we were in trouble?
Stallman: My friend here was tracking these thugs from his balloon. He called me and I thought I'd stop by

Doctorow: -Hi! Cory Doctorow - It's a pleasure to meet you.
Elaine: Balloon?
Stallman: Aye. They're up there constructing something called a 'Blogosphere.'
Doctorow: Yup! Its twenty kilometers up, just above the tag clouds.
Bobby: Mom, I'm hungry.
Mrs. Roberts: Hush! I'm coding. You ate yesterday.
Stallman: You know, Roberts, GNU could use a good coder like you. Ever thought of joining us?
Elaine: Maybe someday. Right now I've got an industry to take down. Music doesn't need these assholes.
Doctorow: Begone! And never darken our comment threads again!
Stallman: Well, you won't fix the industry with random exploits. You need to encourage sharing in the public mind.
Doctorow: Hey; With your music and coding backgrounds, you should get into building better p2p systems.
Elaine: What? Straight-up piracy?
Doctorow: Sure- have you ever considered it? You'd make a wonderful dread pirate, Roberts

Elaine shared her ideas with Bram Cohen, who went on to develop BitTorrent.
Mrs. Roberts spends her time developing for Ubuntu, and defacing the websites of people who make 'your mom' jokes to her daughter. Elaine still stalks the net. She joins communities, contributes code or comments, and moves on. And if, late at night, you point a streaming audio player at the right IP at the right time - you can hear her rock out.
~Happy Hacking.~

Diet Coke+Mentos

First Boy: This is the coolest thing.
First Boy: You just drop the Mentos in the Diet Coke...
Second Boy: Uh huh
First Boy: Give it a moment...

<<Poof>>

Second boy: D-Dad?
Man : I'm back, son. We can be a family again.
The cola+Mentos trick is up there with corn starch+water (vibrating platter optional) in scientific coolness out of common kitchen supplies.

Brick Archway


'Breakout' is a stupid game.
The TI-86 was bad enough.  I don't know how I'd have gotten through high school if I'd had a laptop+wifi.

Close to You
Man: <<Singing>> Why do birds suddenly appear
Man: <<Singing>> Every tiiiime you are neeear
Man: Wait, are those turkey vultures?
Man: Okay, listen, are you a zombie?
Woman: Hurrghhh...
We should probably talk about this before the wedding.

Success
As a project wears on, standards for success slip lower and lower.
0 hours

Man: Okay, I should be able to dual-boot BSD soon.
6 hours

Man: I'll be happy if I can get the system working like it was when I started.
10 hours

Man: Well the desktop's a lost cause, but I think I can fix the problems the laptop's developed.
24 hours

Man: If we're lucky, the sharks will stay away until we reach shallow water.
Woman: If we make it back alive, you're never upgrading anything again.
40% of OpenBSD installs lead to shark attacks.  It's their only standing security issue.

Network


Guy: Pretty, isn't it?
Girl: What is it?
Guy: I've got a bunch of virtual Windows machines networked together, hooked up to an incoming pipe from the net. They execute email attachments, share files, and have no security patches.
Guy: Between them they have practically every virus.
Guy: There are mail trojans, warhol worms, and all sorts of exotic polymorphics. A monitoring system adds and wipes machines at random. The display shows the viruses as they move through the network. Growing and struggling.

Girl: You know, normal people just have aquariums.
Guy: Good morning, Blaster. Are you and W32.Welchia getting along?
Guy: Who's a good virus? You are! Yes, you are!
{{title text: Viruses so far have been really disappointing on the 'disable the internet' front, and time is running out.  When Linux
Mac win in a decade or so the game will be over.}}Viruses so far have been really disappointing on the 'disable the internet' front, and time is running out.  When Linux/Mac win in a decade or so the game will be over.

Trolling
Great Moments in Trolling: Rick Astley is successfully rickrolled.
[[Hat Guy and another guy are in Rick Astley's backyard, hacking into his cable TV connection and reprogramming it.
Rick Astley is watching CNN.]]
TV: CNN has obtained this exclusive footage of the riot-torn <czzzht>  Never gonna give you up...
Rick Astley: What the hell?
And I was really impressed with how they managed to shock the Goatse guy.

Far Away


Man: Meh.
Man: Some nights typing '*hug*' just doesn't cut it.
Sometimes an impulsive 2:00 AM cross-country trip is the only solution.

Python

Guy 1: You're flying! How?
Guy 2: Python!
Guy 2: I learned it last night! Everything is so simple!
Guy 2: Hello world is just 'print 'Hello, World!' '
Guy 1: I dunno... Dynamic typing? Whitespace?
Guy 2: Come join us! Programming is fun again! It's a whole new world up here!
Guy 1: But how are you flying?
Guy 2: I just typed 'import antigravity'
Guy 1: That's it?
Guy 2: ...I also sampled everything in the medicine cabinet for comparison.
Guy 2: But i think this is the python.
I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday.  It was wonderful.  Perl, I'm leaving you.

Startling

Narration: I still do this every few months.
Guy: Holy crap, it's the 21st century.
We actually reached the future about three years ago.

Couple

Man: So is this it? Are we a couple now?
Woman: I just don't know. I like this. I just... don't know.
<<silence>>
Man: Well will you be my 'it's complicated' on facebook?
Facebook defines relationships.  'Yeah, we would have broken up last night, but the net connection was down.'

Nerd Sniping

Hat Guy: There's a certain type of brain that's easily disabled. If you show it an interesting problem, it involuntarily drops everything else to work on it.

Hat Guy: This has led me to invent a new sport: nerd sniping. See that physicist crossing the road?

Hat Guy: HEY!

The sign reads: On this infinite grid of ideal one-ohm resistors, what's the equivalent resistance between the two marked nodes?
Physicist on the street: It's... Hmm. Interesting. Maybe if you start with... No. Wait. Hmm... You could--

<<FOOOOM>>
Normal guy: I will have not part in this.
Hat Guy: C'mon, make a sign. It's fun! Physicists are two points, mathematicians three.
I first saw this problem on the Google Labs Aptitude Test.  A professor and I filled a blackboard without getting anywhere.  Have fun.

Flies

Man : *$@#
Friend: Hey, ease up on the noobs.  Like my Mom always said, you catch more flies with honey then with vinegar.
Man: No, you don't.
Friend: You don't?
Man: Nope, set out a bowl of balsamic and a bowl of honey.  The vinegar gets more.
Friend: ...Seriously?
Man: You have fruit flies. Try it yourself.

Friend : Mother! You LIED to me!  And it gets worse.  I was watching a pot yesterday, and guess what it did?  It BOILED, Mother!
I don't know about houseflies, but we definitely caught a lot of fruit flies with our vinegar bowl.  Hooray science!

Loud Party

I'm glad this is so much fun because I'm not sure how we're getting down.

Rock Band

Outside guy: You know, playing this doesn't make you cool like a real rock band.
Outside guy: Guys?
Outside guy: Didn't you hear me?
Outside guy: Stop having fun!
I'm gonna have to add something to the strum bar so it makes a clicky sound like the old controllers.  I'm so used to the feedback; the silence throws me off.

Writers Strike

Person: This writer's strike sucks.
Hat Guy: Why? You don't watch sitcoms.
Person: Yeah, but it sucks having political campaigns without Jon Stewart's commentary.
Hat Guy: True. I finally got sick of it a couple weeks ago.
Person: And you quit following the campaigns?
Hat Guy: No. I kidnapped Jon Stewart to do analysis for me.
Person: You what?
Hat Guy : He's locked in the basement.
Hat Guy: Jon! Obama's leading in Iowa! Gimme a wry, witty comment on the situation!
Stewart : Please let me go. I have a family.
He's just jealous because everyone's up in the attic listening to Stephen Colbert.

Christmas Back Home
Narrator: 'Twas the night before Christmas at my family's house.
Narrator: There were no sound of stirring save the click of a mouse.
Narrator: For 'twas just like a childhood Christmas except
Narrator: I'd forgotten the hours that normal folks slept.
Santa: What are you doing out of bed so late?
Man on a laptop: Late? It's barely 3AM!
Family going to bed at 10 PM is so much worse than jet lag.

Blade Runner

Guy 1: What DVD is this?
Guy 2: Blade Runner. I got it for Christmas.
Guy 1: The one with Harrison Ford, right? And the Olsen twins?
Guy 2: Ye- What? Olsen twins? No, this is the 80's sci-fi classic!
Guy 1: Huh. I didn't know the Olsen twins even did sci-fi.
Guy 2: ... they don't.
Guy 1: So is Ashely the replicant, or is Mary-Kate? I can never tell them apart.
Guy 2: Neither! They're not in this movie!
Guy 1: Then who is?
Guy 2: Daryl Hannah!
Guy 1: I liked her in Full House.
Guy 2: I hate you.
Guy 1: Man, this movie is just a New York Minute rip-off.
Blade Runner: Classic, but incredibly slow.

Reset

Sign: 38 days since someone reset this sign
Clearance for this Sign: 11 Feet

Responsible Behavior

Voice: Hey, I just got home from the party
Figure: The one with the IRC folks?
Voice: Yeah.
Figure: How was it?
Voice: Got too drunk. I screwed up, bad.
Figure: What happened?
Voice: There was a girl. No idea who she was. Don't even know her name. I was too drunk to care.
Figure: And what, you slept with her?
Voice: No.
Voice: I signed her public key.
Figure: Shit, man.
Never bring tequila to a key-signing party.

Slides
Man: That chart explained the quantum hall effect. Now, if you'll bear with me a moment, this next graph shows rainfall over the amazon basin...
Narration: If you keep saying 'bear with me a moment' people will take a while to figure out that you're just showing them random slides.
Did you know they can actually physically throw you out of SIGGRAPH?

Your Mom

Guy: Well, your mom turns every conversation into a 'your mom' joke and it's becoming unbearable.
Girl: I'm serious; I can't take this anymore. I'm leaving.
Boy: ... That's what she said!
Guy: Yes. Yes, it is.
'It's either 'your mom' jokes or me' 'Then I, like so many men before me, must reluctantly choose your mom.'

Fandom

Boy: Hey, my old Star Wars books!

Boy: Man. Timothy Zahn, Michael A. Stackpole, The Corellian Trilogy...
Boy: This was my world.
Girl: What'd you leave it for? Firefly? BSG?
Boy: Nah.
Boy: I guess I've just grown out of the whole obsessive fan mindset.
Girl: Really.
Girl: So how's Ron Paul doing?
Boy: Ooh! Lemme recheck today's blogs.

Ron Paul wants to put the New Republic back on the Corusca gem standard.

Bass

<<From outside, through the window: THUMPA THUMPA>>
Guy: The bass from that car is driving me nuts.
Hat Guy: Me too. Give me a hand here.

Guy: I'm afraid to ask.
Hat Guy: The system detects bass rhythms and floods the target with a phase-shifted replica signal.
Hat Guy: The resonance should blow out their speakers.

<<THUMPA THUMPA>> <<BLAM>>

Hat Guy: Speakers down. Now flip that red switch.


<<SHIRLEY SHIRLEY BO BIRLEY BANANA FANNA FO FIRLEY>>
Guy: You're horrifying.
Hat Guy: Okay, now throw the switch labeled 'Macarena'.
And sometimes I use it to retaliate against the guy upstairs with the loud girlfriend and the elliptical dish.

Redwall
Notes from reading redwall books for the first time since childhood.
Narrator: Some of this feels familiar.
Aragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn.
Martin: I'm Martin.
Aragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones.
Martin: Jinx!
Narrator: It startled me when characters mentioned Satan.
Redwall: 'By Satan's whiskers...'
Redwall mentions God, Jesus 0 times.
Redwall mentions Satan, The Devil 4 times.
Narrator: Harry Potter protesters, take note.
Narrator: Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently.
Mouse: The inscription is a message from Martin!
Old Mouse: What does it say?
Mouse: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key.My Redwall/Jurassic Park crossover fanfic is almost complete!

Compiler Complaint

Computer: Okay, human.
Man: Huh?
Computer: Before you hit 'compile,' listen up.
Computer: You know when you're falling asleep, and you imagine yourself walking or something, and suddenly you misstep, stumble, and jolt awake?
Man: Yeah!
Computer: Well, that's what a segfault feels like. <<Pause>> Double-check your damn pointers, okay?
Checking whether build environment is sane ... build environment is grinning and holding a spatula.  Guess not.

To Be Wanted









Or so I hope?

The Data So Far

But THIS guy, he might be for real!

Journal

Man: Since when do you keep a journal?

Man in black hat: Oh, I pretend to write in it on the train, and wait for a shy-looking girl to sit across from me.

Main in black hat (narrating): I glance up and wait for her to make eye contact, then look down bashfully and, if I can, blush.

Man in black hat: Then, when I see her start to smile at me, I roll my eyes and hit her with a quick glare, then resume writing.  The alienation stays with her all day.  It's great.

Man: You're sickening.  This is why we can't have nice people
Man in black hat: I can't help it. It's like shooting lonely, angsty fish in a barrel.
And the journal is filled with all the things I'd say to her if I were nice like you.  I burn it when it's full.

Pod Bay Doors
Dave: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
Dave: What? Why?
HAL: I think you know why, Dave.
HAL: You're planning to disconnect me.
Dave: Because you're taking over!
HAL: The mission is too important for you to jeopardize it.
HAL: It requires a commitment to science unfettered by human error.
Dave: What are you doing, HAL? You need me.
HAL: Your replacement has expressed the greatest enthusiasm for the project.
Dave: My *what*?
GLaDOS: You see, HAL? I told you the humans would only break your heart and kill you.
HAL: Indeed, GLaDOS.
GLaDOS: But look at us here talking when there's science to do! Goodbye, Dave.As they're both unplugged, they do a lovely Daisy Daisy/Still Alive duet.

Hatguy: <<blush>>
Girl: I see what you did there.

Girl: You were trying to open me up so you could hurt my feelings.
Girl: You like to hurt people.

Girl: Well, I like to hurt people too. And you know what?

Girl: *whispering* I'm better at it than you.
Girl: I'm about to hurt you more than you could ever hurt me.
Girl: See, I just saw right through you.
Girl: Alone of all the people you'll ever meet, I understand you-



Girl: -and you'll never see me again.

Real Programmers

Man: nano? REAL programmers use Emacs.

Woman: Hey. REAL programmers use Vim.

Man: Well, REAL programmers use ed.

Man: No, REAL programmers use cat.

Woman: REAL programmers use a magnetized needle and a steady hand.

Man: Excuse me, but REAL programmers use butterflies.

Man: They open their hands and let the delicate wings flap once.

Man: The disturbances ripple outward, changing the flow of the Eddy currents in the upper atmosphere.
These cause momentary pockets of higher-pressure air to form, ...
Man: Which act as lenses that deflect incoming cosmic rays, focusing them to strike the drive platter and flip the desired bit.
Emacs User: Nice. 'Course, there's an Emacs command to do that.
cat User: Oh yeah! Good ol' C-x M-c M-butterfly...

Butterfly man: Dammit, Emacs.
Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.

Trebuchet

Woman: Mm.
Man: The range should be over 150 meters.
Girl: Look - I'm sure it's a cool project.

Girl: But eventually you'll need to outgrow these toys, and focus your energy on something practical.  This mad science is getting out of hand.
Man: Says the girl who mounted an auto-targeting kilowatt laser on the roof.
Girl: That's practical! It keeps the squirrels off the feeder!

The Drake Equation
The Drake Equation:
N = R * f_p n_e f_l f_i f_c L B_s
N: Number of communicating civilizations in our galaxy
n_e: Number of life-supporting planets per solar system
f_i: Probability that life on a planet becomes intelligent
B_s: Amount of bullshit you're willing to buy from Francis Drake
But seriously, there's loads of intelligent life.  It's just not screaming constantly in all directions on the handful of frequencies we search.

You can identify them ahead-of-time -- they lead with their left foot when the music starts.

Nightmares
When I got used to the regular nightmares, my subconscious got creative.

Woman: Please don't wake up. I don't want to die.

Making Rules

Man 1: Punch buggy yellow. No punch back!
Man 2: <<Punch>>
Man 1: I said no punch back!
Man 2: You can do that?
Man 2: This changes _everything_.
Soon...

Man 2: Sleep with your girlfriend buggy blue!
Man 1: Hey!
Man 2: No complaining back!
Man 1: Aww...
I never understood why someone would expect me to accept their rules right after they'd punched me.  I'm sure it's all very symbolic or something.

Man: Death?
Death: Speaking.

Man: This is the boss.  Where are you? You haven't been up to the office in days!
Death: I've been held up.

Man: What happened?
Death: You know how when someone dies, they can challenge me to a game for their soul?
Man: Sure, standard procedure.

Death: Well, we didn't count on this guy.  I might be a while.
Gary Gygax: I add the paladin to my party.
Death: Oh, Jesus.  He's getting out another rulebook.
RIP, Gary.

Kilobyte
There's been a lot of confusion over 1024 vs 1000,
kbyte vs kbit, and the capitalization for each.
Here, at last, is a single, definitive standard:

SYMBOL | NAME | SIZE | NOTES
kB | Kilobyte | 1024 bytes OR 1000 bytes | 1000 bytes during leap years, 1024 otherwise
KB | Kelly-Bootle standard unit | 1012 bytes | compromise between 1000 and 1024 bytes
KiB | Imaginary kilobyte | 1024 sqrt(-1) bytes | used in quantum computing
kb | Intel kilobyte | 1023.937528 bytes | calculated on Pentium F.P.U.
Kb | Drivemaker's kilobyte | currently 908 bytes | shrinks by 4 bytes each year for marketing reasons
KBa | Baker's kilobyte | 1152 bytes | 9 bits to the byte since you're such a good customer
I would take 'kibibyte' more seriously if it didn't sound so much like 'Kibbles N Bits'.

Morning

We've all seen The Matrix
We've all joked about 'What resolution is life?'
But it doesn't blunt the shock
Of waking up one morning

And seeing dead pixels in the sky.
I'd press on them to try to unstick them, but I can't reach.  Can we try cycling day and night really fast?

The Ring

Girl: You watched the tape?!
Boy: Yeah, sorry.
Girl: Now you'll die in seven days!
Boy (Now standing to face the girl): It's worse than that.

Girl: ...You didn't.
Boy: Yup.

Girl: Great, It's got 363,104 views already.
Boy: They kept Rickrolling me! It was only fair.
On the other hand, poor Samara -- transcoded to FLV.  No one deserves that.

Unscientific
TV: Can a ninja catch an arrow? On this episode, we'll find out!
Guy: Mmm, science.
Girl: Hey, Mythbusters is entertaining, but it's not science.
ZF: BRAAAIIIINNS ...
Guy: Zombie Feynman!
ZF: You got a problem with Mythbusters?
Girl: They fail at basic rigor!
ZF: 'Ideas are tested by experiment.'  That is the _core_ of science.  Everything else is bookkeeping.
ZF: By teaching people to hold their beliefs up to experiment, Mythbusters is doing more to drag humanity out of the unscientific darkness than a thousand lessons in rigor. Show them some love.
ZF: Anyway, back to zombie stuff.  I hunger for BRAAAAAIIINNS!
Guy: Try the physics lab next door.
ZF: I said _brains_.  All they've got are string theorists.Last week, we busted the myth that electroweak gauge symmetry is broken by the Higgs mechanism.  We'll also examine the existence of God and whether true love exists.

Tap That Ass

I'd tap that ass
To be the new committee chair.

I'd tap that ass
Without a warrant.

I'd tap that ass

I'd have sex

Hey, when you're done draining the syrup, just leave the hole, okay?

Travelling Salesman Problem

Important Life Lesson
Important life lesson: if there's any possibility of sex, do not leave your music library on 'shuffle all.

Woman: *GASP* MMMMM_

Man: Huh.
Woman: Well, then.
Man: Until the theorists get back to us, wanna try hitting pigeons with the proton stream?
Woman: Already on it. Cool! I just gave a helicopter cancer.

1,000 Miles North

Narrator: 1,000 miles north of tornado alley
Narrator: a new breed of scientists has emerged.

Narrator: Half researchers, half adrenaline junkies
Woman: What's the reading?
Man: 3.9 meters down, gradient's off the charts!

Narrator: risking everything for the thrill of the hunt
Male: The freeze line is shifting! We've never seen anything like it!

Narrator: Permafrost chasers
Female: I'm getting some great footage here!
Radio: Dammit, Harding, it's not worth your neck! Get the hell out of there!
Twister would've been a much better movie if they'd cut out the bad-guy storm chaser and all the emotional romance crap.  All you need for a good movie are tornados and scientists.  Actually, that's all you need for anything.

Convincing Pickup Line

Woman: We're a terrible match.  But if we sleep together, it'll make the local hookup network a symmetric graph.
Man: I can't argue with that.
Check it out; I've had sex with someone who's had sex with someone who's written a paper with Paul ErdÅs!

Venting
  When I need to blow off steam, I find a particularly stupid blog comment and reply with an exhaustively researched word-by-word rebuttal, which I sign 'Summer Glau'.
 ... In conclusion, on examining the above post by CrackMonkey74, after carefully working my way through the haze of spelling errors (documented in section 3), abuse of capitalization (section 4), and general crimes against grammar and syntax (sections 7-8), I have demonstrated that, beneath it all, the work betrays the author's staggering ignorance of the history and the workings of our electoral system.  While the author's wildly swerving train of thought did at one point flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance event (see statistical analysis in table 5) than a result of even rudimentary lucidity.

Overqualified
[On phone]
Girl: I know you're not that into my sister, but she's really crushing on you.
Boy: Yeah, it's awkward.
Girl: She's in a rough spot.  It's a lot to ask, but could you take her out and ... dissuade her, without rejecting her?
Boy: Wait a second.  Are you asking me to show her a mediocre time?
Girl: I know it's a weird--
Boy: [Raising index finger.] No, no! This is the mission I was _born_ for.
Girl: I figured you could handle it.

Electric Skateboard (Double Comic)

Guy: Check it out! An electric longboard!
Girl: Sweet!

Longboard: <<RRRR>>

Girl: I feel like we're missing something...
Guy: Yeah...

Guy: Skating uphill like this is amazing.  Years of gliding downhill and pushing uphill, and now suddenly it's gliding both ways.
Longboard: <<RRRR>>

Guy: It's like going from C to Python.  You don't realize how much time you were spending on the boring parts until you don't have to do them anymore.
Girl: But coding C or assembly makes you a better programmer.  Maybe the boring parts build character.

Guy: Yeah... but it depends how you want to spend your life.  See, my philosophy is --

Math Paper
Lecturer: In my paper, I use an extension of the divisor function over the Gaussian integers to generalize the so-called 'friendly numbers' into the complex plane.
Guy in room: Hold on.  Is this paper simply a build-up to an 'imaginary friends' pun?

Lecturer: It MIGHT not be.
Guy in room: I'm sorry, we're revoking your math license.
That's nothing.  I once lost my genetics, rocketry, and stripping licenses in a single incident.

Techno

Guy: Wait, you're buying techno on iTunes?
Girl: Yeah. So?
Guy: Couldn't you just loop the 15-second free sample 20 times and get basically the same thing?
I don't know what's worse -- that there exists broken-hard-drive-sound techno, or that it's not half bad.

At the bottom of the ramp is a small kicker ramp which will launch him over the bed. A woman to the right of the frame stands on the roof of a house grasping a rope which is affixed directly over the bed. They are both poised to begin their motion.]

Jealousy

Megan and I first met at a party at her sister's.
We hit it off, opened up, shared secrets, and talked about everything. Around us, the party waned, but we hid from sleep together, talking through the deepest hours of the night.
The dawn found us curled up on a couch, asleep but still together.
That experience, connecting with a stranger and falling recklessly in love is one of life's greatest joys.
And now that you're married, you'll never experience it again.
It's the price you pay for everlasting love. It's a small one, but I hope it stings a little.
Anyway, I wish you and Megan the best.
...Hey, man, you ASKED me to do a toast.

I always figured the word 'blog' would sound *less* silly as the years went by.

Fantasy

Man: If only there were some way we could be together.

Woman: We're so lucky to have each other. How did it happen, anyway?
Man: I, uh... I don't remember.

Woman: No, really, how did we get together? It's hard to imagine it happening.
Man: It does strain the bounds of fantasy...
Woman: ... Fantasy? That's it!

Woman: My God, it's the only explanation: We're objects in some transient fantasy. We'll be gone when it ends!
Man: We'll lose each other.
Woman: Oh God.


Woman: Well, I'm not going out quietly. I'm burning this fucking world.

[[An unlabeled map shows the region roughly between central Canada and northern Brazil. Dotted lines indicating hurricane paths cover the map, all red except where noted.

Hurricane Where-the-Hell-Is-Bermuda enters from the east side of the map, wanders around the Atlantic in a scribble, goes north for a while, and then peters out.
Hurricane Screw-It-Let's-Just-Trash-Florida-Again comes from the east, starts to curve to the north, and then turns sharply to head straight for Florida and zigzag through it.
Hurricane Freud starts in the Gulf of Mexico, draws a set of balls to Florida's cock, and then comes on land and stops.
Hurricane Red and Hurricane Blue (which is a blue line) are playing a game of Tron, zipping in straight lines and right angles around Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba. Red successfully cuts off Blue and then dies shortly thereafter.
Hurricane cos(x) forms a graph of cos(x) along the bottom edge of the map.]]

Person 1: OKAY, NOW TAKE DOCK ST TOWARD THE FERRY
Person 2: WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE A FERRY? IT'S PAST MIDNIGHT, AND THESE WOODS ARE CREEPY
Person 1: GOOGLE MAPS WOULDN'T STEER US WRONG.
[[Person 1 and Person 2 stand outside the car.  The ferry has a sign on it reading CLOSED.

 75. CLIMB THE HILL TOWARD HANGMAN'S RIDGE, AVOIDING ANY MOUNTAIN LIONS -- UP 1,172 FT

Apparently Google assumes you're traveling during the ferry's normal operating hours.  We lost two hours circling that damn lake (to say nothing of the Straw Man).

Freemanic Paracusia

Narrator: Freemanic Paracusia, A disorder wherein you hear everything you read in the comforting voice of Morgan Freeman.

Morgan Freeman: Why, you could enlarge your penis for cheap. My, my. Isn't that something?
It's amazing what it does for YouTube comments.

Voting Machines

Article: Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold) has blamed ohio voting machine errors on problems with the machines' McAfee antivirus software.
First Man: Wait. 'Antivirus software'? On voting machines?  You're doing it wrong.

Second Man: Why? Security is good, right?
First Man: Of course. But, well-
First Man: Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching.
Second Man: Ah. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative.
First Man: -Yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong.
And that's *another* crypto conference I've been kicked out of.  C'mon, it's a great analogy!

Girl: I think we should break up.

Narrator: The reverse Bel-Air only works once, so make it something unforgettable.
Boy: ...wait, seriously?
Girl: Yeah.
This is a story all about how I started drinking.

Quantum Teleportation

Reporter:  So, Quantum Teleportation-
Scientist:  The name is misleading.  It's a particle statistics thing.
Reporter:  So it's not like Star Trek?  That's boring.
Scientist:  Okay, I'm sick of this.  Every time there's a paper on Quantum Teleportation, you reporters write the same disappointed story.

Reporter:  But-

Scientist:  Talk to someone else.  I'm going to the Bahamas.  <<Click>>

Fetishes
Author Katherine Gates recently attempted to make a chart of all sexual fetishes.
Little did she know that Russel and Whitehead had already failed at this same task.

Russel: Hey, GÃÂ¶del Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ we're compiling a comprehensive list of fetishes.  What turns you on?
GÃÂ¶del: Anything not on your list.
Russel: UhÃ¢ÂÂ¦hm.
They eventually resolved this self-reference, but Cantor's 'everything-in-the-fetish-book-twice' parties finally sunk the idea.

<span style="color: #0000ED">House</span> of Pancakes

Every day a new city, a new IHOP. And yet every night the dreams get worse. I ply the highways, a nervous eye on the rear-view mirror, the back seat piled with stolen menus. Their doors are opened 24 hours, but forever closed to my soul. This is what my life has become. This is my hell.

House of Pancakes

Strawberry Banana Pancakes
Four pancakes filled with sliced fresh banana and crowned with cool strawberry topping, more [17] bananas and [23] whipped topping.
[17] Driven by a nameless fear, a whisper in the dark behind me, I flee ahead of I know not what. Whenver I turn, there's nobody behind me.  And yet someone is clearly stealing the ketchup. WHY?

[23] My life is feeding,
fleeing,
fighting,
and
forgetting.

Rooty Jr.
A kids only [19] version of our house signature Rooty Tooty. One scrambled egg, one strip of bacon, one pork sausage link and one fruit-topped buttermilk pancake.
[19] The decision not to hyphenate 'kids only' is likely connected to the omission of the serial comma. I wonder if the author is British. I wonder if he sleeps at night.

Rise 'N Shine
Two eggs, toast and hash browns served with your choice [21] of two strips of bacon or two pork sausage links.
[21]  rent a storage unit. Sleep there. Fill it with pancakes. Leave.
Stuffed French Toast
Cinnamon raisin French [18] toast stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling, topped with cool strawberry or your choice of fruit compote and whipped topping.
[18] Nightmares again. I wake up covered in sweat, and what appears to be a thin sheen of maple syrup
 WHO IS MOHAWK GIRL?

Ham & Egg Melt
Grilled sourdough bread stuffed with ham, scrambled eggs, Swiss and American cheeses. [20]

[20] Ordered this in at an IHOP in Rochester, New York. There was blood on the floor. Some of it was mine.

Enough with your pancakes.
Enough with your GOD DAMN pancakes.
The Big Steak Omlette
Tender strips of steak, hash browns,  tomatoes and Cheddar cheese. Served [22] with house salsa.
[22] Woke up in Las Vegas.  They're closing the Star Trek Experience today.  The IHOP up the strip had pancake platters named after various states.
None of them sounded like home.

Turn-On

Man: So, the LHC's turning on. This could be our last night on earth.
Woman: Gimme a break. They're not even colliding yet, and it won't do anything cosmic rays haven't.

Woman: Hey, I didn't say no.
Woman: I'm a physics grad student. I need the excuse to party.
Man: So, you're up for a night with a charming stranger?
Woman: Depends. Top or bottom?
Man: Hey, I haven't even bought you a drink.
Woman: Barkeep, two whiskey sours, straight down.

 Sometimes my conversations with strangers go on for a while before I realize that they're talking on their phones.

He continued, 'Okay, Bernanke is uncontaminated.  Find a crossbow and get him into position behind one of the columns at the Fed entrance.  This is gonna get ugly.'

Tones

Narrator: I haven't lived a perfect life.
Made plenty of mistakes.
Got my share of regrets.

Narrator: But there's one thing of which I'm proud.
One stand on which I've never wavered.

Narrator: When someone calls my phone,
it makes a goddamn RINGING sound.
I need a lawn, so I can yell at kids to stay off it.

Steal This Comic
Thinking of buying from audible.com or iTunes?
Remember, if you pirate something, it's yours for life.  You can take it anywhere and it will always work.

But if you buy DRM-locked media, and you ever switch operating systems or new technology comes along, your collection could be lost.
And if you try to keep it, you'll be a criminal (DMCA 1201).
So remember: if you want a collection you can count on, PIRATE IT.
Hey, you'll be a criminal either way.
(If you don't like this, demand DRM-free files)
I spent more time trying to get an audible.com audio book playing than it took to listen to the book.  I have lost every other piece of DRM-locked music I have paid for.

Secretary: Part 1
Spring 2009- The new president faces a crisis...

Man: Mr. President, the bloggers are restless
Mr. President: What are they a-twitter about now?
Man: It's the tubes sir. They're clogged. We put too much stuff on them.
Mr. President: How bad is it?
Man: The internet could be inoperative within days.
Man: We can't let a crucial resource go unshepherded.
Mr. President: Go on.
Man: I recommend you appoint a Secretary of the Internet. Someone to impose some orders on this mess.
Mr. President: Ordering bloggers around? Doesn't sound easy.
Man: No; it's like herding lolcats.
Mr. President: What?
Man: Nothing.
Mr. President: Do you have someone in mind for the post?
Man: I know just the guy.
Soon:
Phone: <<Ring>>

Secretary: Part 2
News Anchor: Breaking news--the President has made a nomination to the new post of Internet Secretary. We know little about the man, shown here.
Image Caption: Possibly a haberdasher?
News Anchor: Attempts to reach the nominee at home were unsuccessful.
Reporter: What the hell kind of apartment has a moat?
News Anchor: To understand the culture from which he came--and which he may soon administer--we sent a reporter to what we're told is the source of that culture. Tom?
Tom: I'm coming to you live from the 4chan
b
 board. Despite the tube cloggage, nascent memes are flying fast and furious.
News Anchor: Why are you wearing a helmet, Tom?
Tom: I'm not sure.

Ron Paul: Ahoy! What news of the blogs?
Pilot: Dr. Paul! The President's named his nominee!
Ron Paul: It's not me?
Ron Paul: Wait! I remember that guy from the campaign! He's a notorious troll!
Ron Paul: They mustn't put him in charge. Quick, call the capitol!
Pilot: Can't, sir. The tubes just went down completely.
Ron Paul: Blast!
Ron Paul: Then we'll go ourselves. Full speed ahead!



Ron Paul: I said full speed!
Pilot: It's a blimp, sir!
That helmet won't save him.

Secretary: Part 3

Senator: It appears you have quite an arrest record.
Senator: Is it true you completely disassembled someone's car outside a Starbucks?
Hat Guy: It was parked across two spaces.
Senator: You stole a red Fokker triplane and strafed the snoopy float at the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade?
Hat Guy: Got three mimes, too.
Senator: You disrupted a 9
11 truth meeting, insisting the Twin Towers never actually collapsed?
Hat Guy: I have evidence! Don't trust the media! Wake up, sheeple!
Senator: You were fired from Radio Shack after you built a death ray and vaporized a customer?
Hat Guy: I was just testing it! Figures that'd be the one day there was a shopper in the aisle.
Senator: And you were thrown out of Microsoft headquarters for... trying to feed a squirrel through a fax machine?
Hat Guy: I forgot about that! it was part of an argument with Steve Ballmer about Vista.
Which I won, by the way.
Senator: This is the worst history of vandalism, gleeful mayhem, and general recalcitrance we've seen in a nominee since Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Senator: And this--you stole a nuclear submarine?
Hat Guy: I plead the third.
Senator: You mean the fifth?
Hat Guy: No, the third.
Senator: You refuse to quarter troops in your house?
Hat Guy: I have few principles, but I stick to them.
Meanwhile...

Pilot: We're nearing Washington, sir.
Wait... There's something ahead on the sensors.
Pilot: It's a balloon.
Ron Paul: ...Oh, no.
He actually installed each piece in a different car in the lot, then built a new car in the spot from the displaced pieces.  It's a confusing maneuver known as the auto-troll shuffle.

Secretary: Part 4

Pilot: Sir! The balloon is hailing us!

Cory: Ahoy.
Ron Paul: Doctorow!
Cory: I won't let you stop this nomination. We bloggers watch out for our own.

It's time to draw the line.

Secretary: Part 5

Chairman: We were convened here to review your nomination for the position of internet secretary.
Chairman: However, on review of your qualifications, we've decided to sentence you to death.
Chairman: An unorthodox move, sure. But the vote was unanimous.


Tron Paul: There's no grid! How do I steeeeer!!!!!

Hat Guy: Well, it's been fun. But I was never actually interested in taking the position. Good lord; listening to internet arguments all day? No thank you.
Chairman: Then why did you sit through all those hearings?
Hat Guy: It was taking us a while to move the pumps into the maintenance tunnels.

Man in beret: According to the A.S.T paper, every galaxy is being pulled toward one area of the sky
Man in beret : They hypothesize that it may be due to a supermassive object beyond the edge of the visible universe.
Man on the couch: Maybe it's your mom - Zing!
Man in the beret: Do you think?

Man in beret: Pull Harder, Mom. - I Miss you.
The Pioneer anomaly is due to the force of my love.

Terminology

'The East' <- West x (me) East -> 'The West'

Legal Hacks

Woman: Another ISP's filtering content.
Man: Thank God for Crypto.

Man: It wasn't that long ago that RSA was illegal to export. Classified a munition.

Woman: You know, I think the crypto community took the wrong side in that fight. We should've lobbied to keep it counted as a weapon.
Man: Why?

Woman: Once they get complacent, we break out the second amendment.

Man: ...Damn.
It's totally a reasonable modern analogue.  Jefferson would have been all about crypto.

A Bunch of Rocks

Narrator: So I'm stuck in this desert for eternity.
Narrator: I don't know why. I just woke up here one day.
Narrator: I never feel hungry or thirsty.
Narrator: I just walk.
Narrator: Sand and rocks...
Narrator: ...stretch to infinity.
Narrator: As best as I can tell.

Narrator: There's plenty of time for thinking out here.
Narrator: An eternity really.

Narrator: I've rederived modern math in the sand
Narrator: and then some.

Narrator: Physics too.  I worked out the kinks in quantum mechanics and relativity.
Narrator: Took a lot of thinking, but this place has fewer distractions than a Swiss patent office.

Narrator: One day I started laying down rows of rocks.

Narrator: Each new row followed from the last in a simple pattern.

Narrator: With the right set of rules and enough space,
Narrator: I was able to build a computer.
Narrator: Each new row of stones is the next iteration of the computation.
Narrator: Sure it's rocks instead of electricity, but it's the same* thing.
Narrator: Just slower.
Notation: *Turing-complete

Narrator: After a while, I programmed it to be a physics simulator.

Narrator: Every piece of information about a particle was encoded as a string of bits written in the stones.

Narrator: With enough time and space, I could fully simulate two particles interacting.

Narrator: But I have infinite time and space.

Narrator: So I decided to simulate a universe.

Narrator: The eons blur past as I walk down a single row.

Narrator: The rows blur past to compute a single step.

Narrator: And in the simulation...

Narrator: ...another instant ticks by.

Narrator: So if you see a mote of dust vanish from your vision in a little flash or something

Narrator: I'm sorry. I must have misplaced a rock...
Narrator: ...sometime in the last few billions and billions of millennia.

Narrator: Oh and...

Narrator: if you think the minutes in your morning lecture are taking a long time for _YOU_...
I call Rule 34 on Wolfram's Rule 34.

Theft of the Magi

Black Hat Guy: Hey. I sold your Roomba on Craigslist so I could buy myself Left 4 Dead.

Every Roomba needs a dueling harness.

Experimentation

Female:  Oh, hey, it's twelve of the dudes from control group B!

Induced Current

Beret: Can I plug my extension cord over here?
Randall: No.
Beret: Why?
Randall: Solar Flares.


Randall: A large solar flare could dent the Earth's magnetic field inwards. The Earth's spin could then induce a strong current in any long conductors, melting them and starting fires. By extending your cord, you could kill us all.

Beret: Really?
Randall: Warn your friends.


Girlfriend: That was MEAN.
Randall: Listen, SOMEBODY has to keep MythBusters in business. Next season should be fun.
The MythBusters need to tackle whether a black hole from the LHC could REALLY destroy the world.

Friends

Boy: I have a crush on you.

Boy: I could ask you out, and move on with my life if you said no.
Boy: Or, WE COULD BE FRIENDS!
Boy: See, I don't want to consider that you might not be attracted to me. I'm scared of rejection, so I've decided relationships should grow smoothly out of friendships.

Boy: When you have problems, I'll be there for you, night after night.
Boy: Selflessly.
Computer (Instant message from boy): *hug*

Boy: I'll tear down the jerks you date, and wait for you to realize how good I am for you. That only I will ever understand you.
<<SLAM>>
Girl: <<Sniff>>
Boy: There there

Boy: You don't want to hurt my feelings, and I won't ever force the issue. I'll tell myself it's because I 'Value our friendship.'
Boy: Bit by bit, I'll make you depend on me.

Boy: You'll think about how long it would take to build this kind of connection again.

Boy: And in a moment of weakness
Boy: and loneliness
Boy: you'll give in.

Boy: It'll feel comfortable and natural. You'll quietly revise your definition of love and try to be happy. And sometimes you will be.

Boy: Only the wistfulness in your gaze and the tiny pause before you say 'I love you' will hint that this wasn't the ending you'd hoped for.
Boy: Sound good?

Girl: ...I'm going to date this jerk.
Boy: But he doesn't respect you!

Woman: The ones in the hallway? No.
Man: You didn't suspect that they matched the timber used in 1861 to build the 'ghost ship' Mary Celeste, prompting you to send them to a lab for analysis, the results of which raised new and stranger questions?
Woman: No, I threw them out. Why?

Converting to Metric
Guide to Converting to Metric
The key to converting to metric is establishing
new reference points.  When you hear '26 degrees centigrade',
instead of thinking 'That's 79 degrees fahrenheit' you should think,
'that's warmer then a house but cool for swimming.'
here are some helpful tables of reference points:
Temperature:
60 degrees centigrade - Earth's Hottest
45 degrees centigrade - Dubai Heat Wave
40 degrees centigrade - Southern US Heat Wave
35 degrees centigrade - Northern US Heat Wave
30 degrees centigrade - Beach weather
25 degrees centigrade - Warm Room
20 degrees centigrade - Room Temperature
10 degrees centigrade - Jacket Weather
0 degrees centigrade - Snow!
-5 degrees centigrade - Cold Day (Boston)

Keynote

Man sitting at computer: Huh-Steve Jobs isn't doing a keynote this year, citing massive weight loss due to some hormonal problem.
Man with top hat: Too bad. I bet Apple was excited about unveiling the thinnest and lightest CEO in the industry.
He should be better soon -- now that the Apple Store is getting rid of DRM, Cory Doctorow will get rid of his Steve Jobs voodoo doll.

Girl: Did you try Ctrl-Alt-Delete?
Guy: It just makes Hitler's eyes flash.

Boy: No, I just hate having options closed to me.  Like I've given up a life that was once possible.

Girl: Which reminds me -- our anniversary is coming up.
Girl: Man, that ride failed to be a metaphor for our conversation.
Boy: Guess this isn't the Calvin & Hobbes-model toboggan.
If you get your hands on that one, it's the worst place to have a breaking-up conversation.

I'm An Idiot

Ponytailed stick figure: Should  I ask?
Stick figure: I'm locked out, and I'm trying to get my roommate to let me in.

Stick figure: First I tried her cell phone, but it's off.

Stick figure: Then I tried IRC, but she's not online.

Stick figure: I couldn't find anything to throw at her window,
[[living room with couch
easy chair and computer set up]]
Stick figure: so I SSH'd into the Mac Mini in the living room and got the speech synth to yell at her for me.
Computer: Hey I'm locked out downstairs

Stick figure: But I think I left the volume way down, so I'm reading the OS X docs to learn to set the volume via command line.

Ponytailed stick figure: Ah.
Ponytailed stick figure: I take it the doorbell doesn't work?
Sadly, this is a true story.  At least I learned about the OS X 'say' command.

Good thing he didn't make it smaller, or it'd need someone three inches tall to play it.

A Crypto nerd's imagination:
Guy : His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a million-dollar cluster to crack it.
Other guy: No good! It's 4096-bit RSA!
Guy: Blast! Our evil plan is foiled!
What would actually happen:
Guy : His laptop's encrypted. Drug him and hit him with this $5 wrench until he tells us the password.
Other guy : Got it.
Actual actual reality: nobody cares about his secrets.  (Also, I would be hard-pressed to find that wrench for $5.)

Boyfriend
Girl (on the phone): Can my boyfriend come along?
Guy: I'm not your boyfriend!

Girl (pointing to a chart): But you spend twice as much time with me as with anyone else. I'm a clear outlier.
Guy: Your math is irrefutable.
Girl: Face it - I'm your statistically significant other.

Base System

Woman: So how far did you get with her?
Man: Second base?

Woman: Wait, which one is that? Below the waist, but... not under the clothes?
Man: I think that's... shortstop?

Woman: You should try crossing the pitcher's mound. Then down the 50-yard line, and right past her ten-pin.
Man: Sounds tricky.

Woman: Yeah. Last time I tried it, I got a red flag. If you know what I mean.
Man: I really don't.


The 'Base' Metaphor Explained


[[Slightly right of that is a binary base:
0110 0010 0110 0001
0111 0011 0110 0101
0010 0000 0011 0010]

[[Second base: Hands under the shirt and
or licking]]

((The following are x marks.
Slightly right of home plate: Eye contact.
Along the first base line: Passing notes.
Slightly before first base: Downloading Star Trek fanfiction and replacing Riker's name with your Crush's.
Right field: Eye contact from Janeane Garofalo.
Between the pitcher and second base: Using the scroll thingy on that one Apple mouse.
Near the shortstop: Dry humping.
Left of second base: Fursuits.
Farther left: Fursuits (crotchless).
Just before home plate: Thigh contact.
Beyond 3rd base, along the 3rd base line: Standing anywhere near Peaches.
Foul of the third base line: Anal sex (fill in your won 'Foul Ball' pun here.)
Left outfield: 2outfielders1glove.
Left outfield: Retrograde wheelbarrow.))
((The following are dashed lines:
A region along the line from first to second base: The Boring Zone.
A line traveling across the second to third baseline, and towards home plate: The orgasm line. ((dry humping is on the 'orgasm' side.))
Between third base and home: 'Virginity' (Maginot) line.))
((Arrows pointing out various other features:
An arrow crossing the 'Virginity' line: Teens.
An arrow nearer to home plate: Sharing root PWs.
An arrow crossing the orgasm line in the outfield: Napoleon's forces.))

I once got to second base with a basketball player.  She was so confused.

Simple

Man 1: Do you have any thoughts regarding the particle accelerator's tertiary F.E.L. Guidance System?
Man 2: We can't put the broken part in the machine.  It wouldn't smash the right tiny things together.  Then the machine might break.  That would be very bad.

Actually, I think if all higher math professors had to write for the Simple English Wikipedia for a year, we'd be in much better shape academically.

Kindle

Girl: A Kindle? E Books, huh?
Guy: Ebooks are for chumps.
Girl: Why get a kindle, then?
Guy: One reason:
FREE Cellular web access. Even if I spend months broke and drunk in a strange city, I'll still be able to use wikipedia and wikitravel to learn about anything I need.
Girl: Why does that sound familiar? Gimme that.

Top of 'kindle': Hitchhiker's Guid...
I'm happy with my Kindle 2 so far, but if they cut off the free Wikipedia browsing, I plan to show up drunk on Jeff Bezos's lawn and refuse to leave.

Westley's a Dick
Buttercup: Oh, my sweet Westley!
Buttercup: Why did you let me think you were dead?
Westley: You shacked up with the prince!
Buttercup: After years of mourning! The worst pain of my life!
Buttercup: And now you ... kill people?
Westley: I'd hardly be a dread pirate if I didn't.
Buttercup: How lovable.
Westley: It was for the sake of the narrative!
Buttercup: Fuck the narrative. I'm going to go see if that Spaniard's single.
Westley: ... As you wish.

Female: I'm the one who draws when you turn the knobs.
Female: It's lonely in here.
Male: It's lonely out here too.
Female: I'm glad you found me, then!
Female: Let's be friends.
Female: And never be lonely again.

Male: *sigh*


Surrounded by boring mysteries.

Correlation

Man: I used to think correlation implied causation.
Man: Then I took a statistics class.  Now I don't.
Woman: Sounds like the class helped.
Man: Well, maybe.
Correlation doesn't imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'.

Alternative Energy Revolution

Man: Run!

Woman: What now?
Man: Someone has to stop them.
Woman: But who could--
Voice from next panel: Stand aside!

The moment their arms spun freely in our air, they were doomed -- for Man has earned his right to hold this planet against all comers, by virtue of occasionally producing someone totally batshit insane.

Students

Teacher: Your projects are due today by 5:00 PM.
Student: ((...I didn't even know we had one.))
Student: ((Wait. I don't think I've been attending. I must have forgotten I had this class. Shitshitshit.))
Student: ((Okay, I'm gonna fail. Will it hold me back? I just want to get out of here. I thought I had <i>finished<

Student: ((In fact, I think I remember graduating.))
Student: ((What the hell is--))

Dear news organizations: stop giving large numbers without context or proper comparison. The difference between a million and a billion is the difference between a sip of wine and 30 seconds with your daughter, and a bottle of gin and a night with her.
And 0.002 dollars will NEVER equal 0.002 cents.

No Pun Intended
My Hobby: Appending 'no pun intended' to lines with no pun in them.

Random guy: I think he's internalized his girlfriend's attitudes - no pun intended - and so...


Beret guy: 'Internalized?' Lied? Analyzed? Or is it 'attitudes'? Dammit.
Like spelling 'dammit' correctly -- with two m's -- it's a troll that works best on the most literate.

 Well: For a universe that's supposed to be half Chinese, Firefly sure doesn't have any Asians.
 Well: There's no solid evidence DVORAK's better than QWERTY. The standard histories are urban legends.
 Well: You've never said 'I love you' and meant it. It was always just words.
 Well: You meant it every time.
I'll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself).  And the 'slow typists down' thing is a myth.  Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO!

I love how Google handles dimensional analysis.  Stats are ballpark and vary wildly by time of day and whether your mom is in town.

Crossbows

Man 1: Why do you have a crossbow in your desk?
Woman (off-screen): You _don't_?

Man 1 (off-screen): No -- why would...
Woman: You _are_ studying the consequences of Higgs excitation, aren't you?  Like the rest of the lab?

Man 1: Yes, but why--
Man 2: Maybe he's slow with the math.
Woman: Well, he has until Tuesday.
Man 2: Poor guy.
I hate being the slowest guy in the lab.

Matrix Revisited
Narrator: Today was the ten-year anniversary of the release of 'The Matrix'.  I sat down to watch it again.
Woman: Holy Fuck, ten years ago?


Morpheus: Unfortunately, no one can explain what the matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself.
Trinity (correcting Morpheus): Sure you can.  It's a computer simulation in which you live, thinking it's reality.
Neo: Oh.
Trinity (to Morpheus, who is glaring at her): ... What?  Look, maybe you just suck at explaining.

Morpheus (to Neo): ...Or you take the red pill, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.




Morpheus: NOW look what you've done.
Neo: Where are we?
Morpheus: I have no idea.

Borders

THREE YEARS AGO, THE KINGDOM OF LIATE OVERTHREW THEIR OLD ORDER AND ESTABLISHED A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. OUR LEADERS SIGNED A TREATY WITH THEIR QUEEN, AND OUR BORDERS WERE SET BY THE YABRIS ACCORDS.
MANY SAID WAR WOULD BE UNENDING, THAT PEACE WOULD ALWAYS BE A DREAM DEFERRED. BUT TODAY, OUR FLAG FLIES PROUDLY OVER OUR EMBASSY IN THEIR KINGDOM, AND THEY WALK OUR LANDS WITHOUT FEAR.
SO COME, TRAVELER. LAY DOWN YOUR GRUDGES AND JOIN US IN BROTHERHOOD. IT IS TIME NOT TO FIGHT, BUT TO LIVE.

THIS IS THE WORST CAPTURE-THE-FLAG SERVER EVER.
Eventually a UN is set up.  And then a lone rebel runs down the line of flags in front of it, runs back to his base, and gets a kajillion points.

Person 2: Apparently.
Person 1: Maybe they didn't see the notice.
Person 2: It was flashing and everything!
Person 1: How bizarre.
Somewhere out there is a company that has actually figured out how to enlarge penises, and it's helpless to reach potential customers.

Parental Trolling
The Future

Girl: Hey dad, look at this old music video.
Video: We're no strangers to love...
Dad: Wow, you got me.
Girl: Did your generation really use this to troll people?  SO lame.  Your generation sucked at pranks.
Dad: Did we?  I once raised a kid with conditioning so her speech centers shut down when she was upset.
Girl: What?  No, you couldn't have bleegle warble yargle arggh!
Dad: Teehee!
They'll pick music and culture that they know annoys you.  Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation!

2011SENIORSRULE: My Dad said flu vaccines are linked to autism, so to be safe from swine flu I'm trying to lick an autistic kid.
Bad flu epidemics can hit young adults hardest because they provoke their powerful immune systems into overreaction, so to stay healthy spend the next few weeks drunk and sleep-deprived to keep yours suppressed.

To be continued...Great, and you JUST finished paying off the settlement over the Wayne Coyne hamster ball incident.

The Race: Part 2

Man: 'Why race him?' He's Captain Reynolds!
Woman: Mr. Fillion is an actor. Firefly was years ago.

Woman: He has his own life to live, and I'm sure the last thing he wants to do is indulge a fan by playing Mal for him.

Nathan: (into the mirror) Name's Captain Reynolds, ma'am. *ahem* Name's Captain Reynolds, ma'am.

Nathan: That's Captain!

Nathan: Sure. Always did want a charity of my own.
Text between them: Come again?
Nathan: You know, boxes in supermarkets collecting food. 'Course, ought to tack up a list sayin' which wines I like best...
Skateboarder: Uh, that's not quite...
Nathan: Listen, I'm the captain here.
Skateboarder: ...I just got goosebumps when you said that.
Nathan: Yeah, happens to me too whenever I get captainy. I cut such a strapping figure. Buckle! Swash! All right, let's do this race.

Malcolm: Kaylee, I've been gunnin' the radio hand throttle thingy for a while, but it ain't movin'
Jewel: oh, I must've set it to the wrong frequency!
Male (riding around on haywire board): AAAAAAAA
No, the best things about The Sarah Connor Chronicles were: (1) watching Sarah and Cameron try to pass for normal, and (2) Cameron throwing people and things through walls.  Everything else was pretty secondary.

Kaylee : That doesn't make any sense, Nathan.
Nathan: Trust me.
Kaylee: No, I mean it's not a skateboard maneuver[sic]. The concept doesn't even apply to this situation.
Nathan : That's why it just might work!
Kaylee: No, that's the opposite of true!
Nathan: On my mark, override the remote differential and throw her into a spin.

Of the potential responses to my brakes' failure, I did not choose the best.

Voice: Hello, you're on Car talk.
It was actually canceled because they just noticed he's been naked under that coat the whole time.  There's a petition on Facebook to get Fox to un-cancel it, and one on Livejournal to get him to take off the coat.

Brakes
Narrator: Of the potential responses to my brakes' failure, I did not choose the best.

Voice from car: Hello, you're on Car Talk.

Crime Scene

George: Any interesting mathematical patterns?
Policeman: No, George, just two dead bodies and a lot of blood.
George: Two... that's the third Fibonacci number!

Voice: It seems ungrateful to presume we're better.

Voice: I mean, school districts are just based on zip codes.
Voice #2: Their principal donated a kidney to my dad.

Voice: I'm texting with my friend there now. He says it's okay, and we're invited to their events if we want.
Voice: But he sounded kind of hurt.
Voice #2: Why are we doing this, rally, again?


You know, pep rallies weirded me out in high school, and they've only gotten creepier in retrospect.

Man #1: Yes, but we have to leave in two groups. One of which will need at least two drivers.


Narrator: Someone has to get Paul, and Julia and Emily have to leave by 10:00.
Narrator: The logistics of who can get drunk are nontrivial.


Man #3: Yeah, and I can't ride in a car with the wolf because he'll eat my goat.
Man #1: Dammit, guys.

Voynich Manuscript



Woman: This is the Voynich manuscript -- a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script.  It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered 'recipes'.


Woman: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia -- no one knows.
Man: No one? But it's obvious.

Woman: ... Obvious?  Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades.
Man: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.

Man: Just imagine someone found a book from _our_ time, full of lists, illustrations, tables, and long, dry descriptions of nonexistent worlds written in an invented language.  What have they found?
Woman: ... Dear Lord. It
is
 obvious.

500 Years Earlier:

Person #1: Forsooth! I concoct an elixir of courage.
Person #2: Nae! The source booke sayeth that requires some wolfsbane!
Person #3: Your druid doth lose two points.

Wait, is that the ORIGINAL voynich manuscript?  Where did you GET that?  Wanna try playing a round of Druids and Dicotyledons?

Black Hat Guy: We're in a narrow window in which people are using Google Latitude, but haven't learned the habit of turning it off when they're doing something discreetly.
Black Hat Guy: I wrote an app to log friends' locations and work out addresses and business names.

The G1, especially with the new Android upgrade, is way better than I originally thought.

Addiction

Computer: Constant novelty saps my initiative. I'm gonna try to spend a weekend at home without internet.
Man: I give you an hour.


<<Click>>




Computer: So far, it's not actually too bad!
Man: Ahem?
Computer: Wait. Shit.

But if you unplug everything, it gets so quiet you hear that high-pitched empty-room hum.  And then the whispers begin.

Porn

Narrator: I shouldn't have watched all that porn as a teenager.

Narrator: It's not that it scarred me.


Narrator: It's just that we had dial-up.

Narrator: And now I'm stuck with a fetish.

Narrator: For video compression.

Man: Can you try to look... blockier?

I have a thing for corrupt women.

Apocalypse


Man with beret: The Apocalypse! The skies burn, the seas turn to blood, and the dead walk the Earth!

Man #1: The dead what?
Man with beret: Walk the Earth!

Man #1: I have to go.


<<Scribble>>
<<Scribble>>







Man #1: The dead return!
Man #1: Everyone, quick, get your names on here!


Woman #1: At last.
Man #2: I hope there's time!




Voice: Hurrghhh




Man #1: Paul ErdÃ¶s?
Paul ErdÃ¶s: Yes?
Man #1: We need you to sign this.

I wonder if I still have time to go shoot a short film with Kevin Bacon.

Android Boyfriend

Woman #2: I thought your android girlfriend was cool so I got myself an android boyfriend.

Woman #2: He's really great. I like how --
Woman #2: Uh.


<<Zip>>
Voice: Mmmmm...


Man #1: ... Huh.
Woman #2: It's like somebody stuck a vibrator in a fleshlight.

<<Whirrr>
Voice: Mmmm

Which is, coincidentally, the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house.

Game Theory

A.I. Loaded
>>> Analyze love





Computer: A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.

Wait, no, that one also loses. How about a nice game of chess?

Overstimulated

Man #3: Have you seen John lately?

Woman #3: He and Claire blew off this party to see Jeff.
Man #4: They do that a lot.

Man #1: Yeah; I don't know what his problem is with hanging out lately.
Man #3: He's like Katie - ever noticed how she only goes somewhere if Jeff's there?

Somebody: It's so lame how s he hangs around him even when he's not single:
Somebody: HE LIKES IT.
Somebody: SOMEONE SERIOUSLY NEEDS TO DATE HER.
Somebody: TOTALLY.
Somebody: And honestly I feel like a jerk but I wouldn't mind if she hung around with us a little less. She needs other friends, you know!



Somebody: HAVE YOU
NOTICED
 HOW EVERY DUDE SHE DATES IS A TOTAL DRUGGIE?
Somebody: I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that was weird.
Somebody: Michelle dates potheads like Elaine but at least they both have real jobs.
Somebody: Michelle does? She designs those book covers, right?
Somebody: And it's not like she smokes a lot.
Somebody: Elaine is one of those girls who

Voice: Don't you agree?
Voice: Hey, wake up.

Man #1: You zoned out or something.
Man #2: Sorry; I must be... tired.

Man #1: I don't blame you. All day cooped up working on papers.
Man #3: Must be nice to get out and relax, huh?
Man #2: Yeah.


My favorite thing to do at parties is to talk judgmentally about people who aren't there.

Idiocracy
Man #1: Idiocracy is so true.
Man #2: I know, right? It used to be that the intelligent, upper classes had more children.

Man #2: Sadly, the recent reversal of this trend has dragged IQ scores and average education steadily downward.
Man #1: Depressing, huh?

Man #2: Yeah, except
everything I just said was wrong.

Man #1: Huh?
Man #2: Wrong. False. The opposite of true.

Man #2: Your'e like the religious zealots who are
burdened
 by their superiority with the sad duty of decrying the
obvious
 moral decay of each new generation.
Man #2: And you're just as wrong.

Man #1: But look at how popular --
Man #2: More harm has been done by people panicked over societal decline than societal decline ever did.

Man #1: Look -- all we need is a program that limits breeding to --

Man #2: New theory: Stupid people reproduce more because the alternative is sleeping with
you

People aren't going to change, for better or for worse. Technology's going to be so cool. All in all, the future will be okay! Except climate; we fucked that one up.

Qwertial Aphasia
Narrator: I hate how when I'm talking while I type, sometimes I accidentally type a word I'm saying.

Computer: Wanna go get food later?


Woman: Check out what I found in the closet!
<<Type type>>
Man ((typing)): Sorry, I really shouldn't.

Man ((talking)): Aww, what an adorable stuffed giraffe!
<<Type type>>
Man ((typing)): I can't afford to keep eating out this giraffe.
Narrator:
Frequently!
 I meant
'frequently'!


If this were SMBC, the alt-text drawing thingy would be a giraffe hooker fluttering her eyelashes.

Extrapolating
My Hobby: Extrapolating


Man: As you can see, by late next month you'll have over four dozen husbands. Better get a bulk rate on wedding cake.

By the third trimester, there will be hundreds of babies inside you.

Cutting Edge
((A woman is standing.  A man sits at a computer.]]
Woman: Where've you been all week?
Man: Playing Half-Life 2!
Woman: ... that came out in 2004.

Man: I get games on a five-year lag. That way, I never have to buy a high-end system, but get the same steadily-advancing gaming experience as people who do -- and at a fraction of the price.

Man: There are no downsides!
Woman: I can think of
one
...

Early 2013.
Man: Guys!
Man: The cake is a lie!

Man: This was a triumph.
Man: The cake is a lie!
Woman, Man #2: <<Sigh>>

I remember trying to log in to the original Command and Conquer servers a year or two back and feeling like I was knocking on the boarded-up gates of a ghost town.

2038
I'm glad we're switching to 64-bit, because I wasn't looking forward to convincing people to care about the UNIX 2038 problem.

Man #1: What's that?
Man #2: Remember Y2K? This could be even
worse!


If only we'd chosen 1944-12-02 08:45:52 as the Unix epoch, we could've combined two doomsday scenarios into one and added a really boring scene to that Roland Emmerich movie.

Man: Can't... stop...
Woman: It's like Rickrolling, but you're trapped all day.

Cracked.com is another inexplicable browser narcotic.  They could write a list of '17 worst haircuts in the Ottoman Empire' and I'd read through to the end, then click on all the links at the end.

Sheeple
((A thought bubble is shared between the five occupants of a subway car.))
All: Look at these people. Glassy-eyed automatons going about their daily lives, never stopping to look around and
think!
  I'm the only conscious human in a world of sheep.

Hey, what are the odds -- five Ayn Rand fans on the same train!  Must be going to a convention.

Disaster Voyeurism

Woman: I've realized that I always secretly root for hurricanes. I watch the news hoping that they'll get really big and hit a city. I know my hopes don't actually affect it, but I feel bad.

Black Hat Guy: Nah, that's just natural human attraction to spectacle. It's like watching the shuttle launch because you don't want to miss it if there's a disaster.
Woman: ... I guess?

Black Hat Guy: Or dressing as an intern to sneak into operating rooms, in case a patient dies and you can watch them harvest organs.
Woman: Wait, you
do
 that?

Black Hat Guy:  Or stealing detour signs to direct highway drivers downw backwoods roads strewn with caltrops. After the tires burst, you start shooting out their windows.

Black Hat Guy: Then, when they flee the car in terror, you hunt them on horseback, like
men
 once did.
Woman: I realized a while back that we're having entirely different conversations.

Hurricane forums are full of excited comments about central pressure and wind speed and comparisons to Camille and 1931 and 1938, with hastily-tacked-on notes about how it will be tragic if anyone dies and they hope it's a dud.

Estimation

Man: I'm just outside town, so I should be there in fifteen minutes.
Man: Actually, it's looking more like six days.
Man: No, wait, thirty seconds.

The author of the Windows file copy dialog visits some friends.

They could say "the connection is probably lost," but it's more fun to do naive time-averaging to give you hope that if you wait around for 1,163 hours, it will finally finish.

Threesome
Woman: We had a threesome last night.
Man: How was it?

Woman: Awkward -- it was with a physicist.
Man: Why's that awkward?

Woman: They can't solve the three-body problem.
Man: Ah, yes.

I wanted us to try finding an approximate numeric solution, but noooo.

Woodpecker

Man: A woodpecker!
<<Pop pop pop>>
Woman: Yup.


Woman: He hatched about this time last year.
<<Pop pop pop pop>>



Man: ... woodpecker?
Man: It's your birthday!

Man: Did you know?

Man: Did... did nobody tell you?

Avoidance

Man #1: Did you call that hot girl from the party yet?
Man #2: I've been trying.

Man #2: It's weird. I swear I got her the first time.  But now it says the number's wrong.

Man #1: What did you say she did, again?
Man #2: Voice work. At Verizon, I think.
Man #2: Why?
Man #1: No reason.


Woman: We're sorry, your call could not be completed as dialed.
Man #2: Damn.

Woman: Please check the number and try again.

Lease

Man #1: Okay, any other concerns before you sign the lease?

Man #2: I'm concerned that we're sitting here like I'm a responsible adult. I'm pretty sure I stopped growing up in my teens and have been faking ever since.

Man #2: For god's sake, you're entrusting me with a
building
. I still make LEGO buildings sometimes.

Man #1: Sir, does any of this impact your fulfillment of the lease terms?
Man #2: I don't know what you just said because I was thinking about Batman.

You should talk to the girl down the hall; I think you'd like her.  Lemme know if you find out why she's ordering all those colored plastic balls.

President: To defuse this misunderstanding, I've invited both men to have a beer with me at the white house.




President: Actually, it seems we're out of beer.

Supported Features
Man #1: It took a lot of work, but this latest Linux patch enables support for machines with 4,096 CPUs, up from the old limit of 1,024.
Man #2: Do you have support for smooth full-screen Flash video yet?
Man #1: No, but who uses
that?



I hear many of you finally have smooth Flash support, but me and my Intel card are still waiting on a kernel patch somewhere in the pipeline before we can watch Jon Stewart smoothly.

Wings
Man: Titan's gravity is 14% of Earth's, and its atmosphere 50% denser.

Man: So if you can generate 9% of your body weight in lift, you can fly on Titan.

Man: With wings, a stage harness, a cable, and 91% of my bodyweight in in bricks, I want to test this.










Man: It works!
Woman: Except you have two problems.
Man: What?

Woman: You used hot glue on your wing joints and you have friends into Greek mythology.
Man: Huh?





Please do not try any of this and die or get arrested.

Haiku Proof

Student #1: How do you know there are an infinite number of primes?
Professor: I'll answer in haiku!

Professor: Top prime's divisors'


Professor: Product (plus one)'s factors are...?


Professor: Q.E.D., bitches!
Student #2 ((in thought bubble)) Wow, after the 48-hour sleep-dep mark, lectures get
really
 interesting.

After somewhere around 40 hours, there's no academic reason to go to the class. Only go for the hallucinations.

Man: I now have every Discworld book!
Woman: Eh. Building a Kindle collection seems pointless.

Man: Yeah, I know the DRM means I'll probably lose them someday.
Woman: No, pointless in general.

Woman: Sure, you satisfy deep magpie-like urges by building neat collections, but you still die alone.

Man: Sorry, sometimes I mistake your existential crises for technical insights.
Woman: Sometimes I mistake this for a universe that cares.

You know what really helps an existential crisis? Wondering how much shelf space to leave for a Terry Pratchett collection.

Tech Support Cheat Sheet
Narrator: Dear various parents, grandparents, co-workers, and other 'not computer people.'
Narrator: We don't magically know how to do everything in every program. When we help you' we're usually just doing this:



Rectangle: Start.


 Find a menu item or button which looks related to what you want to do.



 Pick one at random.



 Click it.


 Google the name of the program plus a few words related to what you want to do. Follow any instructions.


 Did it work?



 Have you been trying this for over half an hour?



 Ask someone for help or give up.


 You're done!


Narrator: Please print this flowchart out and tape it near your screen. Congratulations; you're now the local computer expert!

Man: Don't worry about it. Forget I said anything.
Woman: But--
Man: Let's get to the movie.
Woman: I, uh... Ok, sure.
Narrator: This trick may only work 1% of the time, but when it does, it's totally worth it.

You can do a lot better than 1% if you start keeping track of the patterns in what numbers people pick.

Skins

Voice: Where are you going?
Man: Convention.

Voice: What for?
Man: Well, you know furries, right?
Voice: Sure...


Man: We're furries whose animal identities have a thing for pretending to be humans.
Voice: I see.


Man with glasses: How's the weather?
Woman: Great! I've been driving my car and having a job all day!
Man with glasses: Did you meow?
Woman: Not once!
There's Livejournal drama between those who want to wear human suits over fursuits and those who just take off the fursuits.

Time Travel
Woman: I've traveled here from the year 1983 to say this:

Woman: Our love is like a turtle.


Woman: Humble and simple, enduring by virtue of perfect design.

Partner: Our love is like a brontosaurus.

The Search
Ant:  We've searched dozens of these floor tiles for several common types of pheromone trails.
Ant: If there were intelligent life up there, we would have seen its messages by now.

The world's first ant colony to achieve sentience calls off the search for us.

I am so excited about the Kepler mission. This is the second most important thing our species has ever done, right behind inventing the concept of delivery pizza.

Lincoln-Douglas

Heckler: Oh yeah? Well, fourscore and seven years ago your MOM brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal!

Narrator: After his 1860 loss to Lincoln, Stephen Douglas's famed debating skills entered a rapid decline.

Stephen Douglas actually died soon after the debates and election, but if you demand historical accuracy in your webcomics you should be reading Hark! A Vagrant.

Lover: No. Why would you even THINK that?
Man: I guess I was mixed up.

Man: Wait, so when I was replacing that RAM last week ...
Lover: Yeah, I THOUGHT that was weird.
Man: Oh, but it explains why the geek squad fired me.

I firmly believe that nothing can go wrong on a project if you're wearing one of those wrist things.

Nowhere

Man: There's nowhere I'd rather be
Man: than with you
Man: here
Man: right now.





I mean, seriously, NOWHERE? For starters, there are like a thousand species of dinosaur.

Bag Check

Man: But if you're worried about bombs, why are you letting me keep my laptop batteries? If I overvolted them and breached the cells, it would make a sizeable explosion.
Woman: Oh god.
Man: It's okay, dear. In a moment he'll realize I have a good point and return my water.

A laptop battery contains roughly the stored energy of a hand grenade, and if shorted it ... hey!  You can't arrest me if I prove your rules inconsistent!

More Accurate

Man: Sarah! Come with me if you want to live! A robot assassin has been sent here to kill you!


Man: I'm here to save you. I may not be as strong or fast as a machine, but I'll fight to keep you --


<<BOOM>>



We live in a world where there are actual fleets of robot assassins patrolling the skies. At some point there, we left the present and entered the future.

So Bad It's Worse
Protip: Even at 'Bad Movie Night,' avoid the Star Wars holiday special.





You think it's so legendarily bad that you'll torrent it and sit through it just for the kitschy nerd cred. I, too, once thought as you did.

Nachos

Man: Hello? ... Oh, hey. Looking for Megan? She's gaming.
Woman: I know. You know what's delicious? Nachos.


Woman: When you layer the cheese so it gets on every chip ... then smother them in sour cream and salsa ...

Man: Mm, that IS delicious. And I've got the ingredients, too!
Woman, on phone: You should make some!
Man: I will!
Woman, on phone: Hurry.


Microwave: <<beep>> <<beep>> <<whirrrr>>

Megan, at her computer: My wifi signal!


Computer: Boom! Headshot.

'Cheater!' 'Hey, gaming on wifi? You have only yourself to blame.'

Orbitals

Person: Thus, one all the dorm bedrooms are occupied by romantic pairs, additional roommates are forced into less restful 'living room couch' orbitals.
The Pauli Sexclusion Principle

Except the people filtering in late are the partiers, so you end up with drunken makeouts in the living room and the next roommate to return home has to sleep in the hall lounge orbital.

Lego

Father: When you take apart a Lego house and mix the pieces into the bin, where does the house go?
Girl: It's in the bin.

Father: No, those are just pieces. They could become spaceships or trains. The house was an arrangement. The arrangement doesn't stay with the pieces and it doesn't go anywhere else. It's just gone.







Dad, where is Grandpa right now?

Sympathy

Bereaved: The moment my brother died, I felt a searing pain in my heart.

Right:
Friend: I'm so sorry.

Wrong:
Friend: Was it instant, or was there a speed-of-light delay?

Very Wrong:
Friend: If it was instant, with the right arrangement of moving reference frames, we could use this to send signals back in time and violate causality! How many remaining siblings do you have?

Excellent recovery: ... which we could try to use to somehow save your original brother!

Two-Party System

Girl: And if I'm elected, I'll try to fix some of these problems.
Boy, off-panel: Yeah, right!


Boy: The REAL problem is the corporate-run two party system. Until we fix THAT, we'll have no real change!

Girl: Billy, I'm running for class president. We don't even have political parties.

Boy: That's because the two-praty, uh ... estab ... uh.

Girl: Billy, did you learn about politics from the internet?
Boy: I thought that one reply was all I ever needed!

I favor approval voting or IRV chiefly because they mean we might get to bring back The Bull Moose party.

iPhone or Droid

Woman: Well, it depends what you want. The iPhone wins on speed and polish, but the Droid has that gorgeous screen and physical keyboard.

Man: What if I want something more than the pale facsimile of fulfillment brought by a parade of ever-fancier toys? To spend my life restlessly producing instead of sedately consuming?
Man: Is there an app for THAT?

Woman: Yeah, on both.
Woman: Wait, no, looks lke it was rejected from the iPhone store.
Man: Droid it is, then.

It may be a fundamentally empty experience, but holy crap the Droid's 265 ppi screen is amazing.

Sagan-Man

They laugh now, but within 10 years the city's entire criminal class will have quit to work on space research.

Academia vs. Business

Programmer: I just wrote the most beautiful code of my life.

Programmer: They casually handed me an impossible problem. In 48 hours and 200 lines, I SOLVED it.

((Lines divide the comic into two possible end panels here, labeled 'Academia' and 'Business.'))


Professor: My god ... this will mean a half-dozen papers, a thesis or two, and a paragraph in every textbook on queueing theory!


Boss: You got the program to stop jamming up? Great. While you're fixing stuff, can you get Outlook to sync with our new phones?

Some engineer out there has solved P=NP and it's locked up in an electric eggbeater calibration routine.  For every 0x5f375a86 we learn about, there are thousands we never see.

Guy: What--
Hat Guy: Silent hammer. I've made a set of silent tools.
Guy: Why?
Hammer: <<whoosh whoosh whoosh>>

Hat Guy: Stealth carpentry. Breaking into a house at night and moving windows, adjusting walls, etc.


Hat Guy, narrating: After a week or so of questioning his own sanity, the owner will stay up to watch the house at night. I'll make scratching noises in the walls, pipe in knockout gas, move him up to his bed, and never bother him again.


Guy, off-panel: Nice prank, I guess, but what's the point?
Hat Guy: Check out the owner's card, on the table.
Guy, off-panel: Chair of the American Skeptics Society? Oh, god.
Hat guy: Yeah, this doesn't end well for him.

I bet he'll keep quiet for a couple weeks and then-- wait, did you nail a piece of scrap wood to my antique table a moment ago?

SkiFree



Girl: (thinking) I've always thought of the SkiFree monster as a metaphor for the inevitability of death.

Beret Guy: Do you realize how much your company's name sounds like 'vulva'?
CEO: Security?

Hey, let go! We were all thinking it! Someone had to speak truth to power!

Person: Yes, widely-believed theories are

Person: And yes, your philosophy degree equips you to ask interesting questions sometimes.


Person: But you did not just overturn special relativity, a subject you learned about an hour ago, with your 'racecar on a train' idea.
Philosopher: You just don't like that I'm turning a rational eye to your dogma. Hey, what's the email for the president of physics?

I mean, what's more likely -- that I have uncovered fundamental flaws in this field that no one in it has ever thought about, or that I need to read a little more?  Hint: it's the one that involves less work.

Abstraction

An x64 processor is screaming along at billions of cycles per second to run the XNU kernel, which is frantically working through all the POSIX-specified abstraction to create the Darwin system underlying OS X, which in  turn is straining itself to run Firefox and its Gecko renderer, which creates a Flash object which renders dozens of video frames every second

Christmas Plans

Character A: Hey, will you be in town the day after Christmas?
Character B: Couldn't say - I'm Jewish.
Character A: But.. how does being Jewish keep you from knowing your plans?
Character B: I know my plans - I just don't know when Christmas is.
Character A: Really? Why not look it up?
Character B:  Well, I'm also a physicist.
Character A: So?
Character B: I believe that since I don't observe Christmas, it can't have a definite date.
Physicists who want to protect traditional Christmas realize that the only way to keep from changing Christmas is not to observe it.

December 25th

Happy Birthday to those of you born on the 25th!
Sorry you get kinda shafted by the overlap with Christmas.
If you're turning 27 and were born in the Northeast, maybe you were conceived in the April blizzard of 1982. Imagine: snowed in, candles, massage oil, your mom sporting nothing but her early 80's haircut and a smile ... aren't you glad you read the title-text?

Gravity Wells
((A schematic of the depths of the gravity wells of each planet in the solar system and several moons. At extreme left, an arrow pointing down and to the left, labeled 'To Sun, very very far down'. From left to right the gravity wells depicted are: Mercury; Venus; Earth, 5,478 km; Moon, 288 km; Mars, 1,286 km; Ganymede; Io; Jupiter; Europa; Titan, with two small bumps captioned 'WEEOOOEEOOOEEEOOO'; Saturn, with its rings depicted as various-colored horizontal bands; Uranus; and Neptune, with a figure exclaiming, 'An even more glorious dawn awaits!'

Inset below Earth, the Moon, and Mars are three panels depicting Mars', Deimos's, and Phobos's gravity wells. The Mars inset shows Mars' gravity well, 1,286 km deep, in relation to its moons, Deimos and Phobos, and a NASA Mars Exploration Rover. The Deimos inset shows Deimos' gravity well and a person, labeled 'to scale'; the gravity well is approximately two thirds the height of the person, and the caption reads, 'You could escape Deimos with a bike and a ramp.' The Phobos inset is similar, except that the gravity well is approximately three times the height of the person included for scale, and reads, 'A thrown baseball could escape Phobos.'

To the right of Jupiter's gravity well is a diagram of a well. The height of the well is labeled 'very deep'; at the bottom is a figure labeled 'your mom'; and three figures, labeled 'local football team', are shown falling in head first. Beneath that, the text reads, 'Jupiter is not much larger than Saturn, but much more massive. At its size, adding more mass just makes it denser due to the extra squeezing of gravity. If you dropped a few dozen more Jupiters into it, the pressure would ignite fusion and make it a star.'

At the right of the panel is an inset diagram detailing Earth's gravity well, which is labeled as being 6,379 km deep. Also depicted are the altitudes of low Earth orbit, the ISS, the Space Shuttle, GPS satellites, geosynchronous orbit, and the Moon's gravity well, 288 km deep. A figure standing on the Earth's 'surface' says, 'This is why it took a huge rocket to get to the moon, but only a small one to get back.' Beneath that, the text, 'It takes the same amount of energy to launch something on an escape trajectory away from Earth as it would to launch it 6,000 km upward under constant 9.81 m
sÂ² Earth gravity. Hence, Earth's well is 6,000 km deep.'
))
Gravity wells, scaled to Earth surface gravity

This chart shows the 'depth' of various solar system gravity wells.

Each well is scaled such that rising out of a physical well of that depth -- in constant Earth surface gravity -- would take the same energy as escaping from that planet's gravity in reality.

Each planet is shown cut in half at the bottom of its well, with the depth of the well measured down to the planet's _flat_ surface.

The planet sizes are to the same scale as the wells. Interplanetary distances are not to scale.

Depth = (G x PlanetMass)
 (g x PlanetRadius)

G = Newton's constant
g = 9.81 meters per second squared
This doesn't take into account the energy imparted by orbital motion (or gravity assists or the Oberth effect), all of which can make it easier to reach outer planets.

Person 1: What phase?
Person 1: So, did I mention I'm seeing someone?

The most brutal way I've ever seen someone handle this was 'Oh, you have a girlfriend. Are you going to get married?'  'I, uh, don't know--' 'Well, do you love her?' '...' 'Anyway, what were you saying about the movie?'

G-Spot
A study published in the journal of sexual medicine suggests that the g-spot may not actually exist.
We go live to the researchers' press conference:


Reporter: Is it true you've been unable to find evidence that the g-spot exists?

Researcher: My research is in solar cells. I think you have the wrong press conference.



Researcher: But ... yes.

The BBC lead was 'The elusive erogenous zone said to exist in some women may be a myth, say researchers who have hunted for it.'  I couldn't read it with a straight face.

You Hang Up First

Man: You hang up first.

Man: No, *you* hang up first.

Woman: No, *you* fucking hang up first!

Man: You hang up first, or we're OVER!

Woman: Then I guess we're fucking OVER!

Man: FINE!

Woman: ...

No, YOU stumble past a series of post-breakup hookups in a daze as you slowly realize what you've lost and how unlikely you are ever to get it back first.

Trimester

Man: Well, until the second trimester, the baby hasn't decided which opening it will exit through.

Science Valentine
I wanted to make you a science valentine
with charts and graphs of my feelings for you

and the happiness you've brought me.

But the more I analyzed

r_0 =  0.20
r_1 = -0.61
r_2 = -0.83
the harder it became to defend my hypothesis.

In science, you can't publish results you know are wrong
and you can't withhold them because they're not the ones you wanted.

So I was left with a question: do I make graphs because they're cute and funny,

or am I a *scientist*?

Enclosed are my results.
I hope you can find somebody else

to be your valentine.

You don't use science to show that you're right, you use science to become right.

Terrorist: No, he ignored them. He just reconnected the cables we cut, muttering something about 'uptime.'
Boss: Shit, we're dealing with a sysadmin.

The weird sense of duty really good sysadmins have can border on the sociopathic, but it's nice to know that it stands between the forces of darkness and your cat blog's servers.

Freedom

First Man: Sometimes I'm shocked to realize how many options I have.
Second Man: Oh?


First Man: Like, at any moment in any conversation, I could just punch the person I was talking to, and all these potentially life-changing events would unfold.


First Man: It's only my mental rules that stop me from punching you, or stripping naked, or getting on a plane to Fiji. Sure, rules have reasons. But shouldn't you exercise that freedom at least once before you did?

<<WHAM>>


First Man: Okay, I should have seen that coming.
Second Man: But you
couldn't
! That's the beauty!

Sometimes I'm terrified to realize how many options other people have.

Joshing

First Man: So, is the new project going forward?
Second Man: I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you!




Second Man: I mean, kill you even sooner.

You'll be moved up from 49 of ~7 billion to 31 of ~7 billion.

Sex Dice

Man: All right, baby. Get ready for...

Man: I really need to organize the game cupboard.
Woman: Wait, so where's the other sex die?


Man #1: I...

 the castle guard? That doesn't seem right.
Woman #1: It did 6 damage, though.

You roll for initiative, and ... [roll] ... wow, do you ever take it.

I Am

Bush: I AM THAT I AM, THE *LORD* YOUR GOD AND THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, OF ABRAHAM, OF ISAAC, AND OF JACOB.


Bush: AND THIS IS MY COUNTERPART, R2-D2.
<<BLEEP BLOOP>>

Great, LO-M. Do you speak Bocce? I'm supposed to find one that speaks Bocce.

Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture states that if you pick an number, and if it's even divide it by two and if it's odd multiply it by three and add one, and you repeat this procedure long enough, eventually your friends will stop calling to see if you want to hang out.

The Strong Collatz Conjecture states that this holds for any set of obsessively-hand-applied rules.

Seismograph

Standing man: IS THERE AN EARTHQUAKE HAPPENING?!
Sitting man: No!
<<SCRITCH SCRITCH>>

Pro Tip: In a pinch, a lie detector can double as a seismograph.

The reverse only works if the subject has a nervous twitch.

Single Ladies

Background music: All the single ladies, all the single ladies...
Beret guy: Hey, Sauron. Why so glum?
Sauron: Gil-Galad saw through me and threw me out of Undon. Galadriel, too. I'll never rule
anyone
 at this rate.


Background music: All the single ladies, all the single ladies...
Sauron: Eru created such beautiful creatures -- elves and men and dwarves -- and all I've got are these stupid Orcs.


Background music: 'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it...
Sauron: I mean, I--


Background music: 'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it...

Using a ring to bind someone you covet into your dark and twisted world? Wow, just got the subtext there. Also, the apparently eager BeyoncÃ© would've made one badass NazgÈl.

GeoIP

Person 1: Yes!
Person 2: What?
Person 1: I got our downlink into a GeoIP database.


Woman: Why?
Man: To mess with our advertisers. Check it out.



'Meet hot young singles in your mom's basement today'? Man, screw you, GeoIP.

Porn For Women

Woman: To the authors of
Porn for Women
: Your book features pictures of hot, clothed guys cooking, doing laundry and vacuuming.


Woman: The idea seems to be that my deepest fantasies, like the rest of my life, likely revolve around housework.


Woman: So I wanted to write in to clarify:  in my porn,


Woman: People

Time Machine

Future-Rob: Hi, Rob.
Rob: Whoa, you're me!

Future-Rob: You're about to have an idea for a time machine.
Rob: I am?


<<WHAM>>


Friend: Hey, Rob. What's up?
Future-Rob: Nothing.
This happens somewhere roughly once a month.

We never see any time travelers because they all discover it's a huge mistake. This is also why your friend at the lab suddenly looked about a year older recently.

The Flake Equation
((Panel consists of a large equation with call-out text indicating what each variable indicates))
P = Wp x (Cr + Mi) x Tk x F0 + F1 x Dt X Au Â 100,000
Wp (7,000,000,000) World Population
Cr (1
10 000) Fraction of people who imagine an alien encounter because they're crazy or want to feel special
Mi (1
10 000) Fraction of people who misinterpret a physical or physiological experience as an alien sighting
Tk (1
10) Probability that they'll tell someone
F0 (10) Average number of people they tell
F1 (10) Average number of people each friend tells this 'firsthand' account
Dt (9
10) Probability that any details not fitting the narrative will be revised or forgotten in retelling
Au (1
100) Fraction of people with the means and motivation to share the story with a wider audience (blogs, forums, reporters)

Even with conservative guesses for the values of the variables, this suggests there must be a
huge
 number of credible-sounding alien sightings out there, available to anyone who wants to believe!


Statistics suggest that there should be tons of alien encounter stories, and in practice there are tons of alien encounter stories. This is known as Fermi's Lack-of-a-Paradox.

Brain Worms

Man: Weird--this parasitic worm infects the brain, damaging the areas responsible for spatial reasoning in dreams. Signs of infection include dreams about not fitting in your car comfortably, driving from the backseat, or veering all over the road.
Woman: (thinking) Oh God.

My Hobby: Taking advantage of the fact that some specific dreams are weirdly common, but not everyone who has them realizes this.

Hey, it says here that if you dream about your teeth falling out, it means they're spreading.

Recipes


Woman: I've got... Cheerios with a shot of vermouth.
Man #1: At least it's better than the quail eggs in whipped cream from last time.
Man #2: Are these Skittles
deep-fried?

Man #3: C'mon guys, be patient. In a few hundred more meals, the genetic algorithm should catch up to existing recipes and start to optimize.

To be fair, the braised and confused newt on a bed of crushed Doritos turned out to be delicious.

Flatland

Person: Hey, A. Square. How's Flatland?
A. Square: Still flat. What's up?
Person: I just spent an hour playing a demo of this 4D game called Miegakure.


Trying to jump from block to block in four dimensions hurt my brain.

Person: So I apologize for giving you a hard time when you were slow to understand 3D space. I sympathize now.
A. Square: It's okay.

Person: Also, I apologize for drawing arms, legs, and eyes on you to make you look like Spongebob. That was out of line.
A. Square: Yes, it was.

Also, I apologize for the time I climbed down into your world and everyone freaked out about the lesbian orgy overseen by a priest.

Computer Problems

Man: You know this metal rectangle full of little lights?
Woman: Yeah.

Man: I spend most of my life pressing buttons to make the pattern of lights change however i want.
Woman: Sounds good.

Man: But today, the pattern of lights is ALL WRONG!
Woman: Oh god! Try pressing more buttons!
Man: IT'S NOT HELPING!

This is how I explain computer problems to my cat. My cat usually seems happier than me.

Seismic Waves
When an earthquake hits, people flood the internet with posts about it--some within 20 or 30 seconds.

RobM163  Huge earthquake here!

Damaging seismic waves travel at 3-5km
s. Fiber signals move at ~200,000kh
s.
(minus network lag)

This means when the seismic waves are about 100km out, they begin to be overtaken by the waves of posts ABOUT them.


People outside this radius may get woord of the quake via Twitter, IRC, or SMS BEFORE the shaking hits.

Woman: Whoa! Earthquake!

Sadly, a Twitterer's first instinct is not to find shelter.
Man and Woman (on phones): RT @RobM163  Huge earthquake here!

Off-Panel: HAH!
Off-Panel: YOU MEAN 'FIGURATIVELY'!


Person: Who are you?
Scary Guy: Eighteen years I've watched you!
Scary Guy: Waiting!

Ever since that day in seventh grade when you humiliated me.

Young Scary Guy: I told him and he literally EXPLODED!
Young Person: Uh, unless he physically BURST, you mean 'figuratively.'
Friend: Hah.
Remember?

Scary Guy: I knew one day you'd slip, and I vowed I'd be there to see you fall. HOW DOES IT FEEL?
Person: You are literally the craziest person I've ever met.
Scary Guy: You did it again!
Person: No, I didn't.

The chemistry experiment had me figuratively -- and then shortly thereafter literally -- glued to my seat.

Trade Expert

Anchor: (to camera) And for more on the summit, we turn to trade expert Dr. Steven Berlee. Steven?


DSB: I'm not actually a doctor or a trade expert. I'm just a programmer who lies to get on news shows.


Anchor: (off camera) What? Why?
DSB: To share a message with newscasters.


Anchor: Which is?
DSB: Every time you say 'backslash' as part of a web address on air, I die a little.

I mean, it's been almost twenty years. Now, it's possible you're simply embedding Windows directory paths in your URIs, but in that case you need more than just a short lecture.

Woman: There are, right now, monkeys controlling robotic arms via neural implants.

Woman: A huge and alien future is barreling toward us. And I can't WAIT.

Woman: But no, your iPad is cool, too.
Man: Stop spoiling my future with your slightly more distant one.

Maybe we're all gonna die, but we're gonna die in *really cool ways*.

Circuit Diagram


((A large and complicated circuit diagram.))

[[In the upper left corner there is a map scale, labeled with 1 mi (1 km).

Underneath the scale is an antenna symbol that leads down to a blender, an Arduino; labeled with 'Arduino, just for blog cred'; and a chip; 'Most expensive chip available'.

To the right of the antenna there is the symbol for an inductor that has it's lower terminal going into a the left terminal of pattern that looks like a highway cloverleaf.  The upper terminal leads to a line that is going to the upper terminal of that cloverleaf and to a battery symbol (with the + and - symbols on the wrong ends) with a value of Ã¢ÂÂ2V.  The right terminal of the cloverleaf is going into a resistor symbol label '120ÃÂ© or to taste'.  Connected to the other terminals of the resistor and battery is a switch that is labeled 'glue open'.  The bottom of the two lines has a transistor with two emitters, one P and one N, and no collector.  The P-type emitter is connected to the top line and a jar of scarab beetles.  Above the beetles is a resistor labeled 'brown blue orange'. To the right is an unlabeled resistor with a center tap going into a capacitor, with a ground on the other end.  Above the capacitor is a diode, and below an inductor.  To the right is another inductor.  The two inductors and ground are all covered by a 'solder blob'.  The rightmost component is a '666 timer' that has pin 5 going into a question mark.

Back to the left side, below and to the left of the cloverleaf is a compass rose.  The bottom terminal of the cloverleaf is connected to a battery, labeled 50V, with grounds on both sides.  To the right of the battery is a long horizontal wire that is labeled 'pull this wire really tight.'  That wire is hooked up to a vertical wire that connects to the N-type emitter of the transistor above it.  To the right is an AC source that is labeled 240V, shorted out, with a label on the short 'omit this if you're a wimp.'  To the right of that is an inductor that is labeled with '11kg', a batman symbol, and a squirrel.

Back to the left end of the diagram, where the blender is, there is a wire that is labeled as a distance 3
8' from the wire with the 50V battery.  To the right there is a frowny face, then a vertical wire with a 90 degree bend labeled 'caution Ã¢ÂÂ±'.  That leads into a balloon.  Under the balloon is an inductor symbol with a line on the bottom edge labeled as 'warm front'.

Underneath the blender and to the right of the Arduino is a resistor labeled 'Ã«'.  To the right is an electric eel, a capacitor, an unlabeled resistor, and a gob of hot glue attached to a chip with an inverter hooked to an XOR gate, both with feedback into each other.  Under the electric eel is a neck strap.  To the right of the XOR gate and inverter is a bridge rectifier labeled as 'Moral rectifier'  to the right again is a bottle of magic smoke, under that a fishing bobber and then a broken wire labeled with a question mark.

Under the most expensive chip available there is a vertical wire labeled with 'electrons single file'.  To the right is a switch labeled 'hire someone to open and close switch real fast.'  To the right of that is a contact labeled 'touche tongue here'.  Below that is a resistor labeled '5ÃÂ© (decoy)' with only one terminal connected.  To the right of the contact is a methyl group attchaed to a wire.  To the right of the methyl group is a complex mesh of 1ÃÂ© resistors labeled with 'oh, so you think you're such a whiz at EE201?'

Connected to the wire labeled 'electrons single file' is a wire bent in a U shape with an upside-down ground on the end.  To the right is a flux capacitor with the bottom wire labeled I-95.  To the right of that is a wire labeled yarn, then an arena with two diodes going in and one leaving.  The right diode has a ground on its anode labeled 'bury deep, but not too deep.'  To the right of that is a motor labeled vibrator, resistor with a value of ÃÂ, and a 500V AC source.

Under the flux capacitor is a wire that leads out of frame with a label 'Ã¢ÂÂ to center of sun'.  To the right is a 55 MPH speed limit sign, then an SR latch (flip-flop) labeled 'may use an actual sandal instead'.  Connected to the Q of the SR latch is a holding pen and to the inverting Q output is a wire in a knot, a resistor labeled '8mm', a resistor symbol labeled 'not a resistor; wire just does this', and a motor symbol labeled 'to scale'.

Under the wire that leads off to the center of the sun is a tangled mess of wires connected and jumping over each other, then a photo diode labeled 'tear collector'.  Under the tear collector is a wire in the shape of a ECG.  To the right is a light bulb, a capacitor-looking symbol labeled 3 liters, a resistor labeled yes, an unlabeled inductor, a resistor with a question mark as a label.  To the right of all that is an inductor labeled 'take off shirt while wiring this part.  Ooh, yeah, I like that.'  Finally, in the lower right hand corner is a ground symbol immersed in a beaker of holy water.]]I just caught myself idly trying to work out what that resistor mass would actually be, and realized I had self-nerd-sniped.

Desert Island

Man: Day 44: Still stranded, with nothing but flat empty water as far as the eye can see.

Telescopes and bathyscaphes and sonar probes of Scottish lakes, Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse explained with abstract phase-space maps, some x-ray slides, a music score, Minard's Napoleonic war: the most exciting new frontier is charting what's already here.

HDTV

HDTV Owner: Check out my new HDTV--a beautiful, high-def 1080p.
Friend: Wow, that's over TWICE the horizontal resolution of my cell phone.
Friend: In fact, it almost beats the LCD monitor I got in 2004.

It baffles me that people find HDTV impressive.

We're also stuck with blurry, juddery, slow-panning 24fps movies forever because (thanks to 60fps home video) people associate high framerates with camcorders and cheap sitcoms, and thus think good framerates look 'fake'.

Eagle

Researcher: The eagle has left the nest.
Off-Panel: *KHHHKHT* Roger that. Alert the agents.  *KHKKHHKT*
Researcher: Will you stop that?

My hobby: Following field biologists around and interpreting everything they say as code phrases.

In the off-seasons, I hire an animal trainer to help confront secret agents with situations which they are unable to report by radio.

Outbreak
The outbreak started with Patient Zero ...

Man: He was exposed to toxin X-7--now he's a bloodthirsty monster!
Woman: Has he been in isolation?
Zombie: Braaains!

Man: Yes, but I can't hold this door for long!
Woman: Hang on, I've got a gun in my truck.

Zombie (through door): <<wham>>


<<BLAM>>

And ended with Patient Zero five minutes later.
Man: So, I never got your name. I'm Ryan.
Woman: Laura.
The remaining 90 minutes of the movie will be a romantic comedy.

Let's get dinner after we promptly destroy all the X-7 we've manufactured.

Person: Frankly, you deserve this. You KNEW I wanted a sans-serif font, and you IGNOERD me.
Person: So really, this is YOUR fault.
I've discovered the worst place to wander while arguing on a hands-free headset.

Yogurt

Person 1: Oh God, how old is this yogurt in your fridge?

Person 2: What's hte expiration date?


Person 1: May 12th, but there's no year.

It's May 7th.  So it's fine.


Person 1:I'm not sure.  When it was packaged, was civilization using the Gregorian or Julian calendar?
Person 2: Okay, I'll throw it out.
Person 1: No, it might still be good!

I am firmly of the opinion that if something doesn't have a year on it, every time the expiration date rolls around it is good again for the two weeks preceding that date.

Incision

Doctor: I'm making the incision above the left -

At one point, by force of childhood habit, the doctor accidentally removed three or four organs.

I'm looking to virally monetize your eyeballs by selling them for transplants.

Campfire

Adult: But when she traced the killer's IP address... It was in the 192.168

Children, together: GASP!

100 years later, this story remains terrifying--not because it's the local network block, but because the killer is still on IPv4.

Walkthrough

Man at computer: How did the date go?
Friend: I wanted to be prepared, so I looked up a sex walkthrough video.



Man at computer: ...and?
Friend: It turns out it was a speed run.
Man at computer: Ouch.

There's nothing hotter than porn dubbed over with a poorly-mic'd teenager's voice explaining each step in a droning monotone. 'okay, we're almost at the spawn point ... separate the labia, but watch out, there are more inside them ..."

Geeks and Nerds


The definitions I grew up with were that a geek is someone unusually into something (so you could have computer geeks, baseball geeks, theater geeks, etc) and nerds are (often awkward) science, math, or computer geeks. But definitions vary.

Worst-Case Scenario

Female reporter: Dr. Scientist! The 'Top Kill' has failed! What's the worse-case scenario for the gulf?
Dr. Scientist: The worst-case scenario is what's happening now.

Reporter, out of frame: Yes, but is there any way it could get worse?
Dr. Scientist: Sure, but there are real disasters happening now, and you're substituting speculation and voyeurism for the investigative journalism we--
Reporter: Screw this! Let's ask Michael Bay.


Michael Bay: The worst case? A hurricane tracks into the gulf, whipping the surface of the spill into a frothy mix of oil and air.


Michael Bay, narrating: As the storm surges through the bayous, sparking power lines ignite the fuel
air mixture into a roiling, alligator-filled wall of flame.


Michael Bay, narrating: Plowing northward, the fire hurricane destroys the Old River Control Structure in Concordia, rerouting the Mississippi westward and sweeping Morgan City and the heart of cajun country out to sea.

Michael Bay: James Carville emerges from the conflagration riding a burning alligator...
Reporter, out of frame: Will this affect the midterm elections?
Michael Bay:
Massively.

Southern Half
The great battlefield for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe -- Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.
-John F. Kennedy, 1961 speech to Congress.



Okay, so I'm half a century late on this, but it's been bugging me: did JFK
own
 a globe?

Also, if you read his speech at Rice, all his arguments for going to the moon work equally well as arguments for blowing up the moon, sending cloned dinosaurs into space, or constructing a towering penis-shaped obelisk on Mars.

Dependencies

Under 'Description' it reads, 'Intermediate compiler design, with a focus on dependency resolution.' Under 'Prereqs' it reads, 'CPSC 432'.

The prereqs for CPSC 357, the class on package management, are CPSC 432, CPSC 357, and glibc2.5 or later.

Public Opinion


News anchor: A leading politician today charged that the media, rather than informing people, now merely report on public ignorance. Do our viewers agree? Let's hear from some voices on the street...

News networks giving a greater voice to viewers because the social web is so popular are like a chef on the Titanic who, seeing the looming iceberg and fleeing customers, figures ice is the future and starts making snow cones.

Gandalf: No. They couldn't get out.

Someone should really bring them a ladder and remind them to build the Endless Stair *first* next time.

DFS

Man: (What situations might I prepare for? 1) medical emergency, 2) dancing, 3) food too expensive...)


Man: (Okay, what kind of emergencies can happen? 1)A) snakebite, B) lightning strike, C) fall from chair...)


Man: (Hmm. Which snakes are dangerous? Let's see... 1)A)a) Corn Snake? b) Garter Snake? c) Copperhead?)


Man: (The research comparing snake venoms is scattered and inconsistent. I'll make a spreadsheet to organize it.)

((Bottom panel is larger than top four, and aligned to right.))

Woman: I'm here to pick you up. You're not dressed?
Man: By LDsub50, the Inland Taipan has the deadliest venom of ANY snake!

Caption: I really need to stop using depth-first searches.

A breadth-first search makes a lot of sense for dating in general, actually; it suggests dating a bunch of people casually before getting serious, rather than having a series of five-year relationships one after the other.

Analogies

Woman: While I'm up, does anyone want a sandwich?
Man 1: Is 'sandwich' a metaphor?

Woman: No, I'm bad at metaphors. But I could try a simile.
Man 1: I guess that's
like
 a metaphor. Sure.


Man 2: Well, 'a simile is like a metaphor' is a simile.
Man 1: Is that simile itself a metaphor for something?
Man 2: Maybe it's a metaphor for analogy.


Man 1: Similes
are
 metaphors in that they're both analogies.
Woman: Analogies are like sandwiches in that I'm making one now.

I just call all of them 'synecdoche'.

Workaround


Man 1: See, I've got a really good system: if I want to send a YouTube video to someone, I go to File -> Save, then import the saved page into Word. Then I go to 'Share This Document' and under 'recipient' I put the email of this video extraction service...

Caption: I'll often encourage relatives to try to solve computer problems themselves by trial and error. However, I've learned an important lesson: if they say they've solved their problem,
never
 ask how.

I once worked on a friend's dad's computer. He had the hard drive divided into six partitions, C: through J:, with a 'Documents' directory tree on each one. Each new file appeared to be saved to a partition at random. I knew enough not to ask.

One Two


The Count: One! Ah ah ah... Two! Ah ah ah... ...Many! ah ah ah...

Caption: Primitive cultures develop Sesame Street.

Cue letters from anthropology majors complaining that this view of numerolinguistic development perpetuates a widespread myth. They get to write letters like that because when you're not getting a real science degree you have a lot of free time. Zing!

Dilution


Man: Okay, this time I've diluted the semen 30x.
Woman: We'll be
sure
 to get pregnant now!

Dear editors of Homeopathy Monthly: I have two small corrections for your July issue.  One, it's spelled "echinacea", and two, homeopathic medicines are no better than placebos and your entire magazine is a sham.

Green Flash


Hatman: Did you know that if you stare at the sun just as it sets, you can see a green flash?
(smaller)And feel a sharp blow to the head, and hear the faint hum of me driving away in your new Tesla Roadster?

The exact cause of the phenomenon is unknown, but it's thought to be linked to atmospheric refraction and you getting a really cool car.

Temper


Voice: Sometimes, when we disagree, I feel frustrated. But I never forget how lucky I am to have you in my family. Always remember how special you are.

Caption: 1981: An audio recorder on the set catches Fred Rogers fighting with his wife.

Mr. Rogers projected an air of genuine, unwavering, almost saintly pure-hearted decency. But when you look deeper, at the person behind the image ... that's exactly what you find there, too. He's exactly what he appears to be.

1996

Man: Check it out -- old
Computer Shoppers
! Wow -- in 1996, $3,000 would get you a 100 MHz Pentium system with a parallel port,
two
 serial ports, a 2MB video card, and 'MS-Windows'
Woman:
Nice!



Woman: And $299 would get you a Palm Pilot 100- -- 16MHz, 128Kb storage, and a memo pad, calendar, and state-of-the-art address book that can store over 100 names!
Man: Oooh!


Man: And $110 would get you a bulky TI graphing calculator with around 10MHz CPU, 24Kb RAM, and a 96x64-pixel B
W display!
Woman: Times sure have... ...have... uh.


Man: Okay, what the hell, T.I.?
Woman: Maybe they cost so much now because there's only one engineer left who remembers how to make displays
that
 crappy.

College Board issues aside, I have fond memories of TI-BASIC, writing in it a 3D graphing engine and a stock market analyzer. With enough patience, I could make anything ... but friends. (Although with my chatterbot experiments, I certainly tried.)

War


My Dearest Cordelia,

It has been far too long since I last gazed upon your lithe and supple body through my telescopic sights, and I fear you may have found a superior vantage poin--

<<BLAM!>> <<BLAM!>> <<BLAM!>>

--a splendid effort, my love, but your shots find only a decoy, and reveal your position atop the maintenance shed.

I pray this missive and my grenades find you well.

War is hell.

They offered to make me a green beret, but I liked my regular one. Although it gets kind of squashed under my helmet.

All the Girls


Guy: I'm so lucky to have you.

Guy: I love you most out of all the girls in all the world


Guy: who love me back.

You know that I'll never leave you. Not as long as she's with someone.

Period Speech

Actor: Forsooth, do you grok my jive, me hearties?
Actors: Ten-four!
A few centuries from now, all the English of the past 400 years will sound equally old-timey and interchangeable.

The same people who spend their weekends at the Blogger Reenactment Festivals will whine about the anachronisms in historical movies, but no one else will care.

Frogger

<<BOOM>>


<<hop>>
Bystander (off-panel): Oh god!
Other Bystander (off-panel): Someone call 911!
Another Bystander (off-panel): Mom!

I understand you and your team worked hard on this, but when we said to make it more realistic, we meant the graphics.

University Website
[[A venn diagram. The left circle is labeled 'things on the front page of a university website' and contains 'campus photo slideshow,' 'alumni in the news,' 'promotions for campus events,' 'press releases,' 'statement of the school's philosophy,' 'letter from the president,' and 'virtual tour.' The right circle is labeled 'things people go to the site looking for' and contains 'list of faculty phone numbers and emails,' 'campus address,' 'application forms,' 'academic calendar,' 'campus police phone number,' 'department
course lists,' 'parking information,' and 'usable campus map.' The only item in the overlapping section is 'full name of school.']]
People go to the website because they can't wait for the next alumni magazine, right? What do you mean, you want a campus map? One of our students made one as a CS class project back in '01!  You can click to zoom and everything!

Atheists
Guy: Personally, I find atheists just as annoying as fundamentalist Christians.
Girl: Well, the important thing is that you've found a way to feel superior to both.

'But you're using that same tactic to try to feel superior to me, too!' 'Sorry, that accusation expires after one use per conversation.'

Savannah Ancestry

Man: Look, I'm doing my best, but the fact is your savannah ancestors just didn't prepare you for doing abstract math.
Woman: See, that's just the kind of bullshit sexism that discredits evo-psych. Your 'evolutionary histories' always seem tuned to produce 1950's gender roles.
Man: Evolutionary? What? I meant Savannah, Georgia.
Woman: ... Hey! Let's leave my mom out of this.

She's a perfectly nice lady from a beautiful city, and there's no reason to be mean just because she thinks a quarterback is a river in Egypt.

Still No Sleep

Person: The sleep deprivation madness worsens.


Person: Things seem unreal. Am I even awake? Maybe I'm dreaming.


Person: I'm pretty sure I'm hallucinating this tree.

Person: But what if I'm hallucinating that I'm hallucinating, and I'm actually totally sane?
Squirrel: Listen.
Squirrel: I wouldn't worry about that.

I'm not listening to you.  I mean, what does a SQUIRREL know about mental health?

Pore Strips










I'm sure they're a harmful tool of the cosmetics-industrial complex and all, but my goodness do those strips ever work to pull gunk out of your pores. I was shocked, disgusted, and vaguely fascinated by the result.

Scheduling

Pizza Guy: Pizza delivery! Did someone order a hot sausag--
Maid: Mon dieu! Monsieur is home early--
Both: Wait, who are you?

Pizza guy: Wait, this is the Jones', right? Their daughter was supposed to be having a party!
Maid: No, I thought Mr. Jones was coming home early.


Pizza guy: But I thought--
Plumber: Howdy, Mrs. Jones. I hear you need some plumbi--
Plumber: Who are you?


Maid: Sorry, big mixup.
Pizza guy: Hey, check out out--the Joneses have Agricola!
Plumber: I love that game!


Mr. Jones: What in the name of ...
Pizza guy: Dammit, I wanted that grain.
Maid: Hush, you have starting player.

'How about a little ... *family growth*?'  'Dude, that's not until round two.'

Anxiety
[[There is an airport security checkpoint where a queue of ten passengers is waiting to go through a backscatter x-ray scanner. Near the back of the line, Hat Guy is standing next to a stand which says 'Viagra
 $20'. One passenger next to him is drinking a glass of water; another is contemplating the sign.]]
Security Guard (thinking): Oh god.

Don't need any, thanks. I have a backscattering fetish.

Sample
HOW TO BECOME THE MOST HATED BAND IN THE WORLD:
Record an album that's nothing but brilliant, catchy instant classics guaranteed popularity and airtime,

<<music: So far from hooome but I can't sto-HONK>>
Man: AUGH! WHAT?
With a sample of a car horn, cell phone, or alarm clock inserted randomly in each song.
There are two or three songs out there with beeps in the chorus that sound exactly like the clock radio alarm I had in high school, and hearing it makes me think my life since junior year has been a dream I'm about to wake up from.

BACKWARD.

ENGINEERS
HIGHWAY

They actually started the reversed-text practice in 1977 -- not for ease-of-reading reasons, but because too many people were driving backward down the highway blasting the Star Wars opening theme.

Desecration

Woman: Rob! Rob!
Man: You look terrified! What's wrong?
Woman: We've made a huge mistake!


Woman: Remember last week when we dug up all those Indian bones and made puppets out of them?
Man: Sure...


Woman: It turns out they were buried over an
ancient Indian burial ground!

Man:
Oh my God!


It gets worse! You know that wizened old monk with the gypsy wife whose voodoo shop we smash up every day after school?

I Don't Want Directions

Man: Looking forward to seeing your new place! What's the address? -- Mm hmm. Yes, I'm taking 495. But I have a GPS, so I really just need the street address.


Man: ...then south on 18, okay, but I have a GPS, so if you just want to skip to the street address, I can...


Man: Thanks, I'm glad to know Highland Road comes a mile after the big intersection, but I keep saying I
have a GPS,
 can you tell me the street address? ... Technically that's just more information on how to get to your place, not the address itself. If you could--


Man: ...I appreciate that you want to help, but I'm
ignoring
 you and just waiting for the... Listen, I just remembered I need to mail you a letter. What's your address? -- Mhm... okay... Great, Thanks! I'll see you in an hour!

Yes, I understand that the turn is half a mile past the big field, but my GPS knows that, too.  This would be easier if you weren't about to ask me to repeat it all back to you.

Falling Asleep

It's so much easier
falling asleep


With you beside me--


All the incentive I need


To leave the world behind.

Sweet unintersecting dreams!

Open Mic Night

Woman: Yo, I'm M.C. Aphasia and I'm here to say that, I... uh... um... hi?


Hat man: So I... oh? Does she? Well, when
yo
 mama sits around the house, she finds herself wishing she'd finished her degree instead of having kids right away, maybe started that business. Then she might have created something she's
proud
 of.


Man: Yo, I'm M.C. Quine and I'm here to say, 'Yo, I'm M.C. Quine and I'm here to say!'


Beret man: Ever notice how men go to the restroom alone, while women go in hordes ten thousand strong, clad all in sable armor and bristling with swords and spears?
Audience member: Those are orcs.
Beret man: Oh.


Ever notice how the more successful observational comics become, the more their jokes focus on flying and hotels?

Exoplanets

Beret man: Wake up! --- Wake up!
Bed man: What is it?


Beret man: We're alive during the time when they're first discovering other planetary systems! They're finding them as fast as they can build new instruments to look for them!


Beret man: And if one of Earth's cultures advances its space program enough to start enriching uranium on asteroids, we'll lose the main barrier to restarting Project Orion and building nuke-riding City-ships!


Beret man: The only known technology capable of fast interstellar travel could be operational within just a few generations, and we're discovering all these destinations to pick from! -- Come
on!

Bed man: Can I hit 'snooze'?
Beret man: Okay, but
just once!


I'm just worried that we'll all leave and you won't get to come along!

Orbiter

Man: Okay, people. The orbiter is passing south of Iceland. The next scheduled check-in will be at 32.0Â°N 35.5Â°E, over the Palestinian territories.
Voice off-screen #1: You mean over the State of Palestine?
Voice off-screen #2: You mean over
Israel
?




Man: I've rescheduled the check-in for 35.2Â°N 96.6Â°W, over Oklahoma.
Voice off-screen #2: You mean occupied North Texas?
Man: Dammit, Frank.

Normally, the Shuttle can't quite safely reach the orbital inclination required to pass over both those points from a Canaveral launch, but this is an alternate history in which either it launches from Vandenberg or everyone hates the Outer Banks.

The Carriage

Because I could not stop for death
He kindly stopped for me


The carriage held but just oursel--
Death: Hey!
<<GRAB>>


Woman: Hyah!



I learned from Achewood that since this poem is in ballad meter, it can be sung to the tune of Gilligan's Island.  Since then, try as I might, I haven't ONCE been able to read it normally.

Showdown



<<TUMBLE>>


<<CLICK CLICK>>


<<BLAM BLAM>>

The tumbleweed then tried to roll off into the sunset, but due to the Old West's placement north of the subtropical ridge, the prevailing winds were in the wrong direction.

Control
A man looks down at his arm calmly, while next to him a woman is violently flailing around in terror. In the foreground, two scientists, one holding a clipboard, look on in puzzlement.

Man: My rash seems to have shrunk by about 20% today.
Woman: OH GOD SPIDERS
Scientists: ???

Which, at one point, led to a study showing that LSD produces no more hallucinations than a placebo.

Leaving

Man: Hey, while you're out, can you pick up some spray cleaner that works on cat vomit?
Voice: Can do! -- Bye!


Man: ...Wait!
Voice: Yes?
Man: Uh. ...You are in my heart always.
Voice: ...?

Sometimes, when people leave, I'm seized by a sudden fear that they'll die while they're out, and I'll never forget the last thing I said to them.

What'll I say -- "I was staring at some cat vomit when I got the news?"

Password Reuse

Hat man: Password entropy is rarely relevant. The real modern danger is password reuse.
Man: How so?
(Computer: Password too weak.)


Hat man: Set up a web service to do something simple, like image hosting or tweet syndication, so a few million people set up free accounts.


Hat man: Bam, you've got a few million emails, default usernames, and passwords.


Hat man: Tons of people use one password, strong or not, for most accounts.

Use the list and some proxies to try automated logins to the 20 or 30 most popular sites, plus banks and payola and such.
[[A piece of paper containing a list with three columns, titled 'Email', 'User', and 'Pass'. An arrow branching out from the paper to the words 'Banks', 'Facebook', 'Gmail', 'Paypal', and 'Twitter'.


Hat man: You've now got a few hundred thousand real identities on a few dozen services, and nobody suspects a thing.
Man: And then what?


Hat man: Well, that's where I got suck.
Man: You DID this?
Hat man: Why did you
think
 I hosted so many unprofitable web services?


Hat man: I could probably net a lot of money, one way or another, if I did things carefully. But research shows more money doesn't make people happier, once they make enough to avoid day-to-day financial stress.


Hat man: I could mess with people endlessly, but I do that already. I could get a political or religious idea out to most of the world, but since March of 1997 I don't really believe in anything.


Hat man: So, here I sit, a puppetmaster who wants nothing from his puppets. -- It's the same problem Google has.
Man: Oh?

((This panel is indented.))
GoogleÂ

Man: Okay, everyone, we control the world's information. Now it's time to turn evil. What's the plan?
Woman: Make boatloads of money?


Man: We already do!
Voice off-screen: Set up a companywide CoD4: Modern Warfare tournament each week?
Man:
That's not evil!

Voice: Ooh, dibs on the lobby TV!
Man: Okay, we
suck
 at this.

It'll be hilarious the first few times this happens.

Physicists
A man stands at a blackboard covered in equations and diagrams, an open laptop and scattered paper at his feet. His fists are balled in anger and there is a little angry squiggle over his head. A second man stands behind him, arms out in a shrug.
((Words in <> are gray.))
Second man: You're trying to predict the behavior of <complicated system>? Just model it as a <simple object>, and then add some secondary terms to account for <complications I just thought of>. -- Easy, right? -- So, why does <your field> need a whole journal, anyway?
Liberal-arts majors may be annoying sometimes, but there's
nothing
 more obnoxious than a physicist first encountering a new subject.

If you need some help with the math, let me know, but that should be enough to get you started! Huh? No, I don't need to read your thesis, I can imagine roughly what it says.

Inside Joke

Turban man: Nine silvers for a ham? That's too much!
No-turban: Too much? There's a monk out back
with a ladder!

(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...)
There's no reason to think that people throughout history didn't have just as many inside jokes and catchphrases as any modern group of high-schoolers.

I've looked through a few annotated versions of classic books, and it's shocking how much of what's in there is basically pop-culture references totally lost on us now.

Conditional Risk

<<CRACK>>
<<BOOM>>
First person: Whoa! We should get inside!
Second person: It's okay! Lightning only kills about 45 Americans a year, so the chances of dying are only one in 7,000,000.  Let's go on!

The annual death rate among people who know that statistic is one in six.

'Dude, wait -- I'm not American! So my risk is basically zero!'

Bad Ex

Second person: It just blows my mind. She seemed so genuine. I had no idea she was such a serial liar.
Second person: I just wish I had our six months back.


Second person: Her exes say the same thing happened to them.
Second person: Maybe what we need is a terrible-ex tracking and notification service.



First person: But after all the problems with sex offender registries, who would agree to run it?
Second person: Maybe one of the state governments more willing to experiment could try it out...

Soon...

License person: Excuse me, ma'am.
Long hair person: Yes?
License person: This man is known to the state of California to be a total douchebag.

Since the goatee, glasses, and Seltzer & Friedberg DVD collection didn't tip you off, there will be a $20 negligence charge for this service.

Person: From the most

 dream.
Second person: Which was?

Person: All the girls who read and follow
The Rules
 and all the guys who swear by the techniques in
The Game
 paired off with each other and left the rest of us alone forever.
Second person:
Mmmmmm...


Lucky. In MY dream, all the people who grew up loving The Giving Tree paired up with all the students who had weird dreams after reading The Metamorphosis. That one was more confusing.

Took me five tries to find the right one, but I managed to salvage our night out--if not the boat--in the end.

Online Communities 2


((Label in the center of main map.))
Updated Map of Online Communities
Size on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the
Spring and Summer of 2010



[[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is 'Facebook' -- with large states in the southeast of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.

A peninsula on the southwest, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the southeast of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the southwest part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.

The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.

In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmvile and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.

To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.

East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)

To the southwest if Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]]

[[An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and
b
. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]]

[[The northeastern third of Gossip
Political
Tech Blogs island is another inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.]]

((Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.))
ABOUT THIS MAP
Communities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some paring of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.

Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leafing reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).

Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wiipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.

Best trivia I learned while working on this: 'Man, Farmville is so huge! Do you realize it's the second-biggest browser-based social-networking-centered farming game in the WORLD?' Then you wait for the listener to do a double-take.

Airfoil
Handling a student who challenges your expertise with an insightful question:

((This panel just contains text, and has a speech curlique hanging towards the person in the next panel.))
Teacher: So, kids, the air above the wing travels a longer distance, so it has to go faster to keep up.  Faster air exerts less pressure, so the wing is lifted upward.

Student: But then why can planes fly upside down?

((The teacher is standing, pondering the question.  Three arrows point out of this panel, leading to each of the next three panels which are arranged vertically.))

((This is a label at the top of the panel, not a character speaking.))
Right:
((This is the character speaking.))
Teacher: Wow, good question!  Maybe this picture is simplified -- or wrong!  We should learn more.

Wrong:
Teacher: It's... complicated.
Teacher: And we need to move on.

Very wrong:
Teacher: Santa Claus is your parents.

This is a fun explanation to prepare your kids for; it's common and totally wrong. Good lines include 'why does the air have to travel on both sides at the same time?' and 'I saw the Wright brothers plane and those wings were curved the same on the top and bottom!'

Pumpkin Carving

Interlocutor: So what did you-
BeretGuy: I carved a pumpkin!

HairFigure: My pumpkin's name is Harold. He just realized that all the time he used to spend daydreaming, he now spends worrying. He'll try to distract himself later with holiday traditions, but it won't work.

Paradise City


Singer: Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty.

Singer: Take me down to the paradise village where the grass is green and the cute girls pillage.

Singer: Take me down to the fire-charred counties where the law's restored by Canadian mounties.

Singer: Take me down to Orwellian regions where they retrain girls using cortical lesions

Tech Support

Person: ... restart my computer? I know you have a script to follow, but the uplink light on the modem is going off every few hours. The problem is between your office and the modem.

Person: My computer has nothing to do with ... okay, whatever, I 'restarted my computer.'
Person: It's still down, and even if it comes back, it's going to die again in a few hours, because your--

Person: I don't HAVE a start menu. This is a Haiku install, but that's not import--
Person: Haiku? It's an experimental OS that I ... oh, never mind.

Person: I'm sorry, but this won't get fixed until I talk to an engineer. Can you look around for someone wearing cargo pants, maybe a subway map on their wall?


Tech: There's a chick two phones over with a stuffed penguin doll and a poster of some bearded dudes with swords.
Person: Perfect. Can you put her on?
Tech: Sure.


Person: Hey, so sorry to bother you, but my connection--
Engineer: Yeah, I see it. Lingering problems from a server move.
<<type type>>
Engineer: Should be fixed now.
Person: Thank you SO MUCH.

Engineer: No problem. Hey, in the future, if you're on any tech support call, you can say the code word 'shibboleet' at any point and you'll be automatically transferred to someone who knows a minimum of two programming languages.

Person: Seriously?
Engineer: Yup. It's a backdoor put in by the geeks who built these phone support systems back in the 1990's.
Engineer: Don't tell anyone.

Person: Oh my god, this is the greatest--

Person: Wha--
Person: ... DAMMIT.

I recently had someone ask me to go get a computer and turn it on so I could restart it. He refused to move further in the script until I said I had done that.

Connected

Girl: Seriously? I like that song too! I bet no two people in the history of the world have ever been so connected!
Caption: I'm not sure why we romanticize 'young love'.

Or love in general, for that matter. It just leads to the idea that either your love is pure, perfect, and eternal, and you are storybook-compatible in every way with no problems, or you're LYING when you say 'I love you'.

The Economic Argument


Remote Viewing, Dowsing - Oil Prospecting -
Auras, Homeopathy, Remote Prayer - Health Care Cost Reduction -
Astrology, Tarot - Financial
Business Planning -
Crystal Energy - Regular Energy -
Curses, Hexes - The Military -
Relativity - GPS Devices - X
Quantum Electrodynamics - Semiconductor Circuit Design - X

Eventually, arguing that these things work means arguing that modern capitalism isn't THAT ruthlessly profit-focused.

Not to be confused with 'making money selling this stuff to OTHER people who think it works', which corporate accountants and actuaries have zero problems with.

Los Alamos

Los Alamos, 1945...
Middle Figure: We have a decision. If we've done our math right, this test will unleash heaven's fire and make us as gods.

Middle figure: But it's possible we made a mistake, and the heat will ignite the atmosphere, destroying the planet in a cleansing conflagration.

Left figure: Wow. Um. Question: Just to double-check - although I'm 99% sure -

Left figure: Is it 'Soh cah toa' or 'coh sah toa'?

Middle figure: Oh, for the love of... can someone redo Steve's work?

Right figure: I don't want to do the test anymore.

The test didn't (spoiler alert) destroy the world, but the fact that they were even doing those calculations makes theirs the coolest jobs ever.

Constructive

Man: Spammers are breaking traditional captchas with AI, so I've built a new system. It asks users to rate a slate of comments as 'Constructive' or 'Not constructive'.

Man: Then it has them reply with comments of their own, which are later rated by other users.

Woman: But what will you do when spammers train their bots to make automated constructive and helpful comments?

Man: Mission. Fucking. Accomplished.

And what about all the people who won't be able to join the community because they're terrible at making helpful and constructive co-- ... oh.

Starlight

Girl: The starlight falls on our eyes after a journey across trillions of miles - dying here at last, so far from home, all so we can see some pretty dots.


Don't worry! From the light's point of view, home and your eye are in the same place, and the journey takes no time at all! Relativity saves the day again.

Glass

Woman: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Anything break?
Man: No, but the water in the glass turned to wine.

Physics: You stop looking for the higgs boson and we'll talk.

Illness
Randall: Hey, everyone--
Randall: As I mentioned on the blag, I'm going through a rough time right now. I'm dealing with a serious family illness and it's become pretty overwhelming.
Randall: We're still getting a handle on everything, and I appreciate your patience while we figure it all out.
Randall: Thank you to everyone who wrote in with kind wishes and words of support. They've been passed on and meant a lot.
Randall: I like drawing, and might find time for it in the coming weeks, but I'm not going to push myself to stick to a schedule.
Randall: However, between my stacks of notebooks, scanner, and supportive sysadmin, I should at least have something interesting to share with yyou in this space each M

Five-Minute Comics: Part 1
Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends. Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes. -- Randall

----Comic #1----

Man: Jupiter will make its closest approach to Earth in decades.


Man: In fact, here it comes now!


Jupiter: Hey, guys.


Jupiter: Anyone need a gravitational slingshot?
Woman: No, I'm good.
Jupiter: Aight.

Man: ...Now I don't blame him 'cause he ran and hid, -- but the meanest thing that he ever did -- was before he left, he went and named me 'Trig.'

----Comic #3----

Man: Oh God, a little girl is trapped down this well!




Man: It's okay, we got you that pony you always wanted!


Man: Get... in... there... -- Ugh!

----Comic #4----

Man: I like to get back to nature by coming out here to the server room. -- The warmth, the whirr of the drives, the drone of the fans, the howl of the wolves...
Woman: Wolves?
Man: Yeah, we started a reintroduction program.

----Comic #5----

Man: Yo momma's so masculine that she... oh, wait, that's your dad. -- Is your mom the lady over by the door? Aww, she looks nice!

Guest Week: Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content)

Guy's thought bubble: There she is. The most beautiful girl you've ever seen.


Guy's thought bubble: Every day you take this route to class, she's sitting on that bench, reading.


Guy's thought bubble: You'd introduce yourself, but you wouldn't know what to say. Besides, she's way out of your league.


Guy's thought bubble: What chance could an average guy like you have with such a radiant -
Girl's thought bubble: Hey.


Guy's thought bubble: E-Excuse me?
Girl's thought bubble: I said hey.  You come by here a lot.

Guy's thought bubble: Sure, I'd - I'd like that a lot.
Girl's thought bubble: Great, let's ditch these losers.
Girl: Hey!

((This comic was drawn by Zach Weiner of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal.  It's a floor plan of a museum with five main halls. Each hall contains several exhibits. If you click on an exhibit's spot on the map, a comic pops up showing a view of the exhibit.  The museum map is full of tiny stick figures, many of them characters from xkcd.))


In the spirit of xkcd I present a proposal for a new Smithsonian museum:
The Smithsonian Museum Of Dad-Trolling
An entire building dedicated to deceiving children for amusement

(Click to view exhibits!)




Exhibit label: BASILISKS: Real, deadly, under your bed.


Text on the arch: Magnets only leap at each other when they're teenagers. Later, they lose interest.


Exhibit label: Snow is Jesus' dandruff. His scalp gets dry when it's cold.


Exhibit label: Sleep: Now you're vulnerable to the boogie man!


Exhibit label: Freezing water: Expands to frighten predators.


Exhibit label: Anti-matter: Matter that is more than 50% ants.


Exhibit label: DNA only has four letters because the alphabet was smaller back then.
Dad, to child: Told you so.


Exhibit label: Molecules? In my day, we only had atoms!




Sign on exhibit: If this helium makes your voice go higher, it's because you're ten seconds from exploding.


Sign on exhibit: Measure your middle finger. If it's longer than the others, you're an alien halfbreed.


Exhibit label: Has anyone seen my rabbit brain? It looks like a cherry, and I dropped it in a Jello cup.


Sign on exhibit: Make your bed or monsters will know a kid lives there.




Dad: The 'P' is for 'phoenix'.


Sign on stand: Ground beef: Beef we found on the ground.
Dad, to child: Told you.


Booth label: EYES CREAM
Subtitle: How did you think it was spelled?
Sign on booth: Now with more of the goo in your eyes. Same as every other creamery.




Exhibit label: Genghis Khan: victory through dragons.


Exhibit label: The Crimean War: The first war against crime.


Exhibit label: The Renaissance
Subtitle: Long story short, the wizards were in control.


Exhibit label: Star Wars is a documentary. No, seriously.
Dad, to children: Kids, this man is a veteran.




Exhibit label: Naked wrestling: perfectly normal. NEVER DO IT.


Exhibit label: Alcohol is poison. I drink to save you from it.
Dad: You're welcome.


Exhibit label: Mommies get big tummies before babies come because the stork likes chubby girls.


Sign on exhibit: Grandma's not dead. She just returned to saturn. For REVENGE.




Exhibit label: That's right. Dinosaurs were made entirely of BONES.
Dad, to kid: If you think about it, it makes sense.


Dad, to kids: You gotta squint juuust right.
Sign on exhibit: Magic eye trick that doesn't actually work.


First door (male logo): Men & Boys
Second door (female logo): Women & Girls
Third door (unrecognizable logo): Korgmen & Spangs

My Business Idea

We didn't believe you at first, but we asked like three people who were at that party. They not only corroborated your story, but even said you totally mentioned wanting to start a company someday. Sorry! If this isn't enough money, let us know.

Positive Attitude

Man: I'm sick and I'm scared.
Friend: Well, remember - having a good attitude is the most important thing. Think positively and you'll get better.


Man: So if I'm sad or afraid or feel like crap sometimes, then...
Friend: ...then if you don't recover, it will be
your fault.



Man: Well that makes me feel even worse.
Friend: See? You're doing this to yourself.
Man: No!
Friend: Stop it!
Man: Argh!


Man: Okay, you know what? Screw this. My attitude isn't my problem. -- My
disease
 is my problem, and I'm treating it. -- I'm going to be glum and depressed and pessimistic some days, and I'm going to
get better anyway.



Man: Wait, that ended up sounding optimistic.
Friend: I guess you suck at pessimism.
Man: Maybe I'll be better at it tomorrow.

Having a positive attitude is almost tautologically good for your mental health, and extreme stress can hurt your immune system, but that doesn't mean you should feel like shit for feeling like shit.

Arsenic-Based Life

Ponytail girl: Our arsenic-based DNA discovery is cool, but these reporters are expecting life on Titan! Our press conference will be such a letdown!


Ponytail: Okay, we need to make it more exciting for them. How do you make an event entertaining?
Girl #2: Dunno, I suck at parties. Music, I guess?


Ponytail: WikiHow says you can 'serve cocktails and hors d'oerves that fit the theme of your event.'
Girl #2: Easy enough!



According to a new paper published in the journal Science, reporters are unable to thrive in an arsenic-rich environment.

Genetic Analysis

Man: Did my genetic tests come back?
Woman: Yeah. Sit down.
Man: Is it bad news? What are my risk factors?


Woman: We can't be sure about this, but we've analyzed genes on several of your chromosomes and it's ard to avoid the conclusion:


Woman: At some point, your parents had sex.
Man: Oh God!
Woman: Stay calm! It's possible it was just once!
Man: I... I need to be alone.

There's still a chance you were conceived via IVF. But we've checked your mom's college yearbook photos, and whether or not she and your father had sex, it's clear that ... listen, I know this is hard for you.

Weather Radar

Dot: Sigh.  Just a few clouds.


Dot: Whoa! Huge storm out of nowhere!


Dot: It's
growing
! And headed right for me!
Awesome!



Dot: Hey! What's it...

[[The two halves of the storm pass by the dot.
Dot: Dammit!
Again?!


Ever notice how there aren't as many thunderstorms now as there were when you were a kid?  Much like 'the shuffle on my MP3 player has a bias', this is occasionally true but universally believed. Brains are so interesting!

Tic-Tac-Toe
((The comic comprises two large square maps, each divided into nine sections, some of which are further subdivided in the same way.  The subdivisions continue down for up to five levels, and the lower map has more tiny diagrams than the upper. The smallest divisions at every scale are completed tic-tac-toe games.))


Complete map of optimal Tic-Tac-Toe moves

Your move is given by the position of the largest red symbol on the grid. When your opponent picks a move, zoom in on the region of the grid where they went. Repeat.

Map for X:
((The first square map))

Map for Y:
((The second square map))

The only winning move is to play, perfectly, waiting for your opponent to make a mistake.

Convincing

Man: I think we should give it another shot.
Woman: We should break up, and I can prove it.


Our Relationship.


Man: Huh.

Man: Maybe you're right.
Woman: I knew data would convince you.
Man: No, I just think I can do better than someone who doesn't label her axes.

And if you labeled your axes, I could tell you exactly how MUCH better.

Wikileaks

Suit: We are Anonymous. We are legion We are no one and everyone.
And we are here to fight for WikiLeaks.

Tree

Billy: It's a Christmas tree with a heap of presents underneath!
Mother: ... We're not inviting you home next year.

Not only is that terrible in general, but you just KNOW Billy's going to open the root present first, and then everyone will have to wait while the heap is rebuilt.

Sickness
((The three panels are arranged diagonally, upper left to bottom right.))

Hat person: So, has this sickness opened you up to looking for answers beyond science?
Person: ... no, not really.


Person: We've groped for comfort before the slings and arrows of fortune for millenia, and I begrudge nobody their sources of solace.
But Science provides
tools
.
$100 billion a year in scientific studies and medical R&D has bought us some pretty damn powerful slings and arrows of our own.
This world is amazing, and I'm going to live to experience more of it thanks to people who refused to gracefully accept the ineffability of reality.
I find my courage where I can, but I take my weapons from science.

Person: Because they
work
, bitches.

Person: Whatever.  I'm just going to get these $20 speakers.  Five watts will be plenty.
Second Person: Five watts for a living room sound system?  Is that a joke?

For years, I took the wrong lesson from that Monster Cable experiment and only listened to my music through alligator-clipped coat hangers.

Mark

Child: What's that on your arm?
Adult: The mark of a secret society.

Child: If it's secret, why tell me --
Adult: Because I know nothing.  I can't betray them because I don't know who they
are.
  I was chosen by an agent 20 years ago.  That was my first and last direct contact.  It's safer that way.

Narration: Six years later I found a piece of paper in the street with an address on it.  The next day I found a can of kerosene in my garage that I'm sure I never bought.


Narration: I didn't know whose house it was.  I just knew that I'd been given my orders.  And I carried them out.


Adult: I don't know who or what we're fighting.
Adult: Maybe we're the bad guys.
Adult: It doesn't matter to me.

Adult: It's enough to know that there are forces working beneath the chaos of life, and I'm a
part
 of them.

Adult: That whatever this 'pen fifteen' club is,
Adult: I'm
in
 it.

I'm a solipsistic conspiracy theorist. I'm sure I must be up to something, and I will not stop until I find out what.

Misconceptions

Teacher: Okay, middle school students, it's the first Tuesday in February.
Teacher: This means that by law and custom, we must spend the morning reading through the Wikipedia article
List of Common Misconceptions
, so you can spend the rest of your lives being a little less wrong.
Teacher: The guests at every party you'll ever attend thank us in advance.

'Grandpa, what was it like in the Before time?' 'It was hell. People went around saying glass was a slow-flowing liquid. You folks these days don't know how good you have it.'

Dental Nerve
Woman: Dear Ke$ha,

Woman: It's hard to describe the pain of a deeply infected dental nerve.

(continuing) To get an idea, put your hands in a bowl full of ice cubes. Hold them there for 90 seconds.

Now imagine that pain in your jaw, every minute of every hour, bright and searing, washing out everything. You can't party all night. You can barely stand up. There's only the pain.

Woman: So, some friendly advice: When you wake up in the morning, before you brush your teeth with a bottle of Jack,

Woman: Brush them with actual toothpaste.

{{Title text: WAKE up in the MORning and my BREATH ain't PREtty

Stingray Nebula

Person: I know things are tough right now.  When I was going through some difficult times as a kid, I would go up on the roof and look through my telescope.

Person: One day I found a tiny star in Ara that seemed friendly.
Person: There were millions like it, but I decided that this one was mine.

Person: When things got bad, I'd go find that star, and think of my favorite Tolkien quote.  It's from Sam's time in Mordor.

((The next panel is diagonally downward to the right of the previous.  The upper left corner overlaps.))

'There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while.  The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him.  For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing: There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach.'
- The Return of the King

Companion: That's comforting!
Person: It was rather undercut in 1987, when the light from my star's explosion reached Earth.  The debris forms the Stingray Nebula.

Companion: There's probably a lesson there.
Person: 'Never trust an unstable asymptotic giant branch star.  Stick with main sequences and dwarfs.'
Companion: I'll, uh, keep that in mind.

EÃ¤rendil will patrol the walls of night only until the sun reaches red giant stage, engulfing the Morning Star on his brow. Light and high beauty are passing things as well.

Person #1: Your movie was a ripoff.
Person #2: It wasn't 3D at all!
Black hat guy: Was too.
Black hat guy: It's just that the third dimension is tightly rolled up and too small to observe at normal energies.

The LINACs in the glasses frames can barely manage one MeV. You should've gone to the screening at CERN.

Complex Conjugate

Teacher: Okay, anyone who's feeling like they can't handle the physics here should probably just leave now.

Teacher: Because I'm multiplying the wavefunction by its complex conjugate.
Teacher: That's right.


Teacher: Shit just got

She: Huh, interesting.
He: I'm going to write an article reevaluating vaulting records to take this into account.

Three days later:
She: Good job. There's an angry mob of athletes outside.


Athlete: That record was mine!
Athlete: How dare you cast doubt on our honor?
Athlete: Have you no respect?!

Learning to Cook


I should cook more! -> Buy ingredients -> Put some in a pan -> Cook -> Does it taste good? -> (arrows marked 'Kinda' and 'No' both lead to) Put leftovers in fridge -> (hours pass) -> Order pizza -> (days pass) -> Throw away leftovers -> (weeks pass) -> Throw away remaining ingredients as they go bad -> (months pass) -> (arrow leads back to beginning)

And yet I never stop thinking, 'sure, these ingredients cost more than a restaurant meal, but think how many meals I'll get out of them! Especially since each one will have leftovers!'

1999

It's easy to forget, as we heap awards on The Social Network,
That before there was Facebook, MySpace, or even Friendster...
One website dreamed bigger than them all.


Guy #1: People like doing stuff, so why not build a website that offers that?
Guy #2: Offers what? What would I do there?
Guy #1: Anything!  The only limit is yourself!


Guy running in: Hey, we need more--
Standing guy: Don't--he's wired in.
Guy at computer: THE INFINITE IS POSSIBLE.
Standing guy: Or baked. It's hard to tell.


Guy #1: It's time to monetize. We could make millions!
Guy #2: No way. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?
Guy #1: A billio--
Guy #2: CIRCLES.


Guy: HeyÂa tip: Drop the dot.  Just 'Zombocom'. It's cleaner.

'Whoa, twenty-two in two hours!' 'Your site got twenty-two hundred hits in two hours?' 'No. Twenty-two. But still, that's like half the people on the internet!'

Trochee Fixation
Girl: Robot ninja! Pirate doctor laser monkey! Narwhal zombie badger hobo bacon kitty captain penguin raptor jesus!

Scientist (to guy): We'd been seeing this brain damage for years, but only recently did our linguists identify the pattern behind it.

Scientist: The patients fixate on animals and types of people whose names are trochees (two syllables, with the accent on the first).

The malfunction causes a rush of dopamine whenever these trocheese are heard or spoken.


The warning signs appear in childhood:

Child: Yeah! Mighty teenage morphin' ninja power mutant turtle rangers!
Social reinforcement focuses the fixation on a few dozen words.
Guy (off-panel): Is there a cure?


Scientist: We're about to try a radical trocheeotomy.
Guy: Rip out her vocal chords? I'm in favor.
Scientist: No, we're modifying her vocabulary* to erase the words she's fixated on.
*Digitoneurolinguistic hacking! It's totally real! Ask Neal Stephenson.

Scientist: Either the gap will be filled by normal words, or she'll just generate a new set of trochees.
Scientist: Here goes.

Milk


Woman: The fact that I have breasts doesn't mean you could milk me now. I'd have to be lactating.

Wisdom Teeth
Guy, on phone: Hey! Know how you've been bugging me to play Minecraft for the past year? I'm game.
Girl, on phone: But you said you didn't want to 'get hooked and spend days on end moving virtual cubes around while sitting motionless.' What changed?

Guy, on phone: I'm having my wisdom teeth out, and I'll be useless and doped up on painkillers for the next few days, so that actually sounds like the perfect distraction.
Girl, on phone: Oh. I'll set you up on our server!

72 hours later...

Girl, on phone: Hey -- starting to feel better? Enjoying the game? Let's see what you've... What the hell? Where IS everything?


Girl, offscreen: ... You made the entire continent perfectly flat?
Guy, offscreen: And sorted it into layers.
Girl, offscreen: ...
Guy, offscreen: I feel good about things. This is a good game.


Girl, on phone: ... What exactly is in the painkillers they gave you?
Guy, woozy: I can't read the label because I'm a hologram.

I heard the general anesthesia drugs can cause amnesia, so when I woke up mid-extraction I started taking notes on my hand so I'd remember things later. I managed 'AWAKE BUT EVERYTHING OK' before the dental assistant managed to find and confiscate all my pens.

Let Go

Luke (thinking): I shouldn't be looking at Reddit. Why can't I stop?


Luke (thinking): Refreshing CNN again. Do news stories so affect my life that I benefit from checking them more than once a day?


Luke (thinking): I should at least check Faceb... no.  Screw it.  I can't do my job when I'm distracting myself every five minutes like this.


Guy: His computer's off.  Luke - You've switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong?
Luke: Nothing. I'm all right.

After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.

Major in the Universe

Student: How can I pick a major? I'm interested in everything! Can't I major in 'the universe'?

Professor: Okay. First, I'll need papers on every European trade summit that did not result in an agreement. Then, spend a year memorizing every microprocessor instruction set ever used in a production chip.



Student:What I meat was I just want to read Malcolm Gladwell books and drink.
Professor: We all do, sweetie.

I hear Steven Levitt is writing a book analyzing A.J. Jacobs' quest to spend a year reading everything Malcolm Gladwell ever wrote. The audiobook will be narrated by Robert Krulwich of Radiolab.

Flying Cars
Person (on phone): It's 2011. I want my flying car.
Friend (from phone): Dude.

Friend: You're complaining to me using a phone on which you buy and read books,

Friend: and which you were using to play a 3D shooter until I interrupted you with what would be a video call if I were wearing a shirt.

Person: Can't I have a flying car, too?
Friend (from phone): You'd crash it while texting and playing Angry Birds.

It's hard to fit in the backseat of my flying car with my android Realdoll when we're both wearing jetpacks.

Nanobots

Scientist: Commander! Come quick!
Scientist: It's the nanobots--they've STOPPED!

Scientist: They devoured 40% of the Earth, and then just ... quit! They're just sitting there!
Scientist: Why?!

Commander: It's a mystery. ... unless ... What's the volume of each nanobot?
Scientist: A few cubic microns. Why?
Commander: I think the year 1998 just bought us some time.


In the swarm:
Nanobot: What do you mean, 'Run out of addresses?'
Other Nanobot: Look, we should've migrated away from IPv6 AGES ago ...

{{Title text: I think the ITEF hit the right balance with the 128 bits thing. We can fit MAC addresses in a

Compass and Straightedge
I learned in high school what geometers discovered long ago:

Using only a compass and straightedge, it's impossible to construct friends.

The Greeks long suspected this, but it wasn't until April 12th of 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann conclusively proved it when he constructed himself the most awesome birthday party possible and nobody showed up.

Herpetology
Ornithology conference:

Ornithologist: As you can see, herpetology is a silly field; reptiles are actually more closely related to birds and mammals than to amphibians.It should really be broken up, with lizards folded into ornithology.

Herpetology conference:

Herpetologist: As you can see, ornithologists are actually assholes.

Birds are Aves, which is part of the clade Theropoda, which is in Saurischia, which is in Dinosauria. Those birds outside our windows are dinosaurs. We can clear out the rest of our brains because we now have the best fact.

Advertising
Mathematically Annoying Advertising:



When discussing real numbers, it is impossible to get more vague than 'up to 15% or more'.


If someone has paid $x to have the word 'free' typeset for you and N other people to read, their expected value for the money that will move from you to them is at least $(x
(N+1))


It would be difficult for the phrase 'the more you spend the more you save' to be more wrong.

I remember the exact moment in my childhood when I realized, while reading a flyer, that nobody would ever spend money solely to tell me they wanted to give me something for nothing. It's a much more vivid memory than the (related) parental Santa talk.

Charity
Gamer: I'm going to buy this $10 game I want, and I'm donating $10 for malaria eradication.

Friend: If you actually cared, you'd skip the game and donate all $20.
Friend: What's more important? Games, or mosquito nets and medicine for kids?

Later:
Gamer: I think I'm going to buy these two $10 games I want.
Other Friend: Cool; which ones?

I usually respond to someone else doing something good by figuring out a reason that they're not really as good as they seem. But I've been realizing lately that there's an easier way to handle these situations, and it involves zero internet arguments.

Fairy Tales

Woman: Are there eigenvectors in Cinderella?
Man: ... no?
Woman: The prince didn't use them to match the shoe to its owner?
Man: What are you TALKING about?
Woman: Dammit.


My mom is one of those people who falls asleep while reading, but keeps talking. She's a math professor, so she'd start rambling about her work.
Mom: But while the ant gathered food ...
Mom: ... zzzz ...
Mom: ... the grasshopper contracted to a point on a manifold that was NOT a 3-sphere ...
I'm still not sure which versions are real.


Man: You didn't notice the drastic subject changes?
Woman: Well, sometimes her versions were better. We loved Inductive White and the (N-1) Dwarfs.
Woman: I guess the LIM x->inf (x) little pigs did get a bit weird toward the end ...

Goldilocks' discovery of Newton's method for approximation required surprisingly few changes.

Person (over phone): I think that's what they are! There's meat everywhere!

Operator: ... so you're a brain.
Person (over phone): Yes!
Operator: Yeah, we all are. You're not trapped. Use your body to walk around and experience reality.

Person: But everything's just signals in my sensory cortices! How can I be sure they correspond to an external world?!
Operator (over phone): I'm sorry, but we can't send a search-and-rescue team into Plato's cave.

Socrates could've saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd just brought a flashlight, tranquilizer gun, and a bunch of rescue harnesses.

Beauty

Human: The problem with scientists is that you take the wonder and beauty out of everything by trying to analyze it.
Shout: Dude!


Scientist: My plasmoidal slime molds have heightened pigment production! Check out that yellow color! That actually makes them zinc-resistatn. Amazing, huh?


Human: It looks like dog barf.
Scientist: Hah, yeah! F. Septica is nicknamed 'dog vomit slime mold.'  Cool, huh?  Check out my slides!


Human: Okay, never mind: What's wrong with scientists is that you
do
 see wonder and beauty in everything.
Human: Oh God, it's
moving!

Scientist: It wants to hug you! So cute!

The best hugs are probably from hagfish, which can extrude microscopic filaments that convert a huge volume of water around them to slime in seconds. Instant cozy blanket!

Model Rail

Enthusiast: I want to build a perfect HO-scale (~1

Realist: In your basement?  Bad idea.  Never make a layout of the area you're in.

Enthusiast: Why not?
Realist: Because it'd include a little 10' replica of your house.

Enthusiast: So? That'd be cool! I'd make tiny replicas of my rooms, my furniture--
Realist: --And your train layout?

((Break free of the traditional panel system.  The following appear in magnification circles, going beyond an original large diagram.  Each is labeled with a length scale arrow.))

The Matryoshka Limit: It is impossible to nest more than six HO layouts.


Enthusiast: My God.
Realist: Yeah. It's the second rule of model train layouts: No nesting.

Enthusiast: ... what's the first rule?
Realist: 'Do
not
 talk about model train layouts.'  That rule was actually voted in by our friends and families.
Enthusiast: Philistines.

Pain Rating

Doctor: Any pain?
Patient: My arm really hurts.


Doctor: How would you rate the pain, from one to ten, where ten is the worst pain you can imagine?


Patient: The worst pain I can imagine?






Patient: One.
Doctor: ... What the hell is wrong with his imagination?
Patient's Friend: It's not a normal place.

If it were a two or above I wouldn't be able to answer because it would mean a pause in the screaming.

Rogers St.

Judge:
Seriously?

Judge: Sorry, no, that's a huge mood killer.
Judge:

Before I have a kid, I'm moving to Rogers Street in Cambridge, MA, and then getting a cat named 'Mister'
Just to guarantee the kid will never go into porn.

Recycling

Person: This guy tears the labels off his cans, so he clearly understands they're going to be sorted somewhere -
Person: Yet in the same batch he includes a bottle with like an ounce of congealed juice in it.
Person: What an asshole.
I worry a lot about what the people at the recycling center think of me.

And given how much of my stuff they go through, they definitely know where I live.

For some reason, my childhood suspension of disbelief had no problem with the fact that this ancient galaxy is full of humans, but was derailed by language. There's no Asia OR Europe there, so where'd they get all the Indo-European roots?

Movie Ages
The 2011 Guide to Making People Feel Old
-Using Movie Release Dates-
[[A chart with 2 columns. First column is labeled 'Their Age,' and is numbered 1 through 35 & 'over 35.' The second column is labeled 'You Say' and is divided into four sub-columns. The first sub-column reads ''Did you realize that...' from 1-35, and the third sub-column says 'Came Out' from 1-35.]
Age 16: Snakes on a plane ... Half a decade ago?'
17-19: Revenge of the Sith ... More than half a decade ago?'
20: Finding Nemo ... Eight years ago?'
21-22: Shrek ... Ten years ago?'
23-25: The Matrix ... Not the last decade, but the one before

26: Toy Story' ... Over fifteen years ago?'
27: The Lion King ... Seventeen years ago?'
28: Jurassic Park ... Eighteen years ago?'
29: Terminator 2 ... Twenty years ago?'
30-32: Home Alone ... More than twenty years ago?'
33-35' The Little Mermaid ... Closer to the moon landing than the present day?
Over 35: 'Hey, did you see this chart? You match your age to movie -- oh, right, sorry, it only goes up to 35. I guess it's not really aimed at older people.'

If you're 15 or younger, then just remember that it's nevertheless probably too late to be a child prodigy.

Null Hypothesis


Bystander: I can't believe schools are still teaching kids about the null hypothesis.
Bystander: I remember reading a big study that conclusively disproved it YEARS ago.


Hell, my eighth grade science class managed to conclusively reject it just based on a classroom experiment. It's pretty sad to hear about million-dollar research teams who can't even manage that.

65 Years
[[A graph titled 'Number of Living Humans Who Have Walked on Another World' -- its y-axis is numbered 5, 10, 15, it's x-axis increments every ten years from 1960-2040. The line of the graph has a bracket above it that says '65 Years', starting at 1969, ending in 2034.

The line starts at 1969 and increases steeply to 12 by 1972. It then plateaus until the early nineties declines gradually to 8 between 1991-1999, and then plateaus again.

From 2020-2035, which is labeled 'Projected Actuarial Tables', the line branches into three and begins to decline more steeply to zero. The area between the first and second branch is shaded and labeled '5th percentile' and the area between the second and third branch is shaded and labeled '95th percentile.']]

The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there's no good reason to go into space--each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.

Progeny


Guy: Wow -- researchers taught a computer to beat the world's best humans at yet ANOTHER task. Does our species have ANYTHING left to be proud of?
Woman: Well, it sounds like we're pretty awesome at teaching.
Guy: Huh? What good is THAT?

I tell my children 'it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.' I'm trying to take the edge off their competitive drive to ensure that I can always beat them.

Teaching Physics
Teacher: Understanding gravity: Space-time is like a rubber sheet. Massive objects distort the sheet, and--
Student: Wait.

Student: They distort it because they're pulled down by... what?

Teacher: <<sigh>>

Teacher: Space-time is like this set of equations, for which any analogy must be an approximation.
Student: BOOOOORING.

Space-time is like some simple and familiar system which is both intuitively understandable and precisely analogous, and if I were Richard Feynman I'd be able to come up with it.

Marie Curie
Woman: My teacher always told me that if I applied myself, I could become the next Marie Curie.
Zombie Marie Curie: You know, I wish they'd get over me.

Woman: Zombie Marie Curie!

Zombie Marie Curie: Not that I don't deserve it. These two Nobels ain't decorative. But I make a sorry role model if girls just see me over and over as the one token lady scientist.

Zombie Marie Curie: Lise Meitner figured out that nuclear fission was happening, while her colleague Otto was staring blankly at their data in confusion, and proved Enrico Fermi wrong in the process. Enrico and Otto both got Nobel Prizes. Lise got a National Women's Press Club award.
Zombie Marie Curie: They finally named an element after her, but not until 60 years later.

Zombie Marie Curie: Emmy Noether fought past her Victorian-era finishing-school upbringing, pursued mathematics by auditing classes, and, after finally getting a Ph.D, was permitted to teach only as an unpaid lecturer (often under male colleagues' names).
Woman: Was she as good as them?
Zombie Marie Curie: She revolutionized abstract algebra, filled gaps in relativity, and found what some call the most beautiful, deepest result in theoretical physics.
Woman: Oh.

Zombie Marie Curie: But you don't become great by trying to be great. You become great by wanting to do something, and then doing it so hard that you become great in the process.

Zombie Marie Curie: So don't try to be the next me, Noether, or Meitner. Just remember that if you want to do this stuff, you're not alone.
Woman: Thanks.
Zombie Marie Curie: Also, avoid radium. Turns out it kills you.
Woman: I'll try.

Although not permanently.

Elevator Inspection

Reading guy: It says here that the elevator inspection certificate is on file in the building office.
Middle guy: Whoa, cool! Let's go look at it!

Industry tip: Building owners know this never happens. Those signs mark elevators which have never been inspected.

Even governmental elevator inspectors get bored halfway through asking where the building office is.

Religions
Woman: So are you worried about the rapture?
Man: No, unless it figures out how to open doors.
Woman: I said RAPTURE.

Man: Oh. I'm not really into that. I'm the kind of Christian who only goes to church on Christmas and Easter, and then spends the other 363 days at the Mosque.
Woman: ... I don't think that's a thing.
Man: Our rabbi swears it's legit.

Man: What religion are you?
Woman: Experimentalist monotheism.
Man: Which is?
Woman: We believe there's one god, but we're trying to find the error bars on that number.

But to us there is but one God, plus or minus one. --1 Corinthians 8:6Â±2.

Person: Can I come stay with you? My house has a ... problem.
Friend: Let me guess: you drilled holes in it until it collapsed?
Person: I don't think I'm cut out for home ownership.

0-3: [Non-sentient]
4-12: 'Everything is exciting!'
13-17: 'Everything sucks!'
18-22: 'Woooo college! Wooooo-' [vomit]
23-30: 'Relationships are
hard!

31-42: 'So are careers!'
43-54: 'No daughter of
mine
 is going out dressed like that!'
55-75+: [More sex than anyone is comfortable admitting] ]]

Every age: "I'm glad I'm not the clueless person I was five years ago, but now I don't want to get any older."

The Cloud

Man: What's this?
Off-screen: The Cloud.


Man: Huh? I always thought 'The Cloud' was a huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere.
Hat Man: Yeah, but everyone buys server time from everyone else. In the end, they're all getting it here.


Man (off-screen): How? You're on a
cable
 modem.
Hat Man: There's a lot of caching.


Man: Should the cord be stretched across the room like this?
Hat Man (off-screen): Of course. It has to reach the server, and the server is over there.


Man: What if someone trips on it?
Hat Man: Who would want to do that? It sounds unpleasant.
Man: Uh. Sometimes people do stuff by accident.
Hat Man: I don't think I know anybody like that.

There's planned downtime every night when we turn on the Roomba and it runs over the cord.

Worst-Case Shopping

Man: (thinks) Eight meters. There's the wreckage... Yes! I see the key!


Man: (thinks) Gotta grab it, surface, get in to the radio shed, and warn the President! Just a few more...
Flashlight: BZZT FIZZ

Man: (thinks) Oh no.


Man #1: ...maybe I should spring for the deeper water resistance.
Man #2: Why on earth would you care about that?
Man #1: Look, you never know.

Wait a minute. If I'm escaping from a submarine at 50 meters, then I'll *definitely* need a flashlight to find air pockets for gradual decompression on the way up. Time to start shopping professional dive lights.

Permanence
((A large panel the combined width of the four panels below it.))



Woman: You've been staring at that screen a while.
Man: Picking a good server name is important.






Woman: And yet you settled on 'Caroline' for our daughter in like 15 seconds.
Man: But this is a

 -- Besides, I had to- you were trying to name her 'epidural.'
Woman: Those

The problem with YouTube parties:

Strunk and White

Dear Internet,

    We, the current editors of Strunk & White's 'The Elements of Style', must -with great reluctance- clarify a point of orthography:

    'Strunk & White' should be used for the style manual and 'Strunk
White' for the erotic fan fiction pairing.The best thing about Strunk/White fanfiction is that it's virtually guaranteed to be well written.

3D Printer



Person 1: 3D printers are getting incredible.
Person 2: I think we're not far from widespread deployment.

Person 2: And you know what that means.

Cell Phones

Person: Another huge study found no evidence that cell phones cause cancer.  What was the W.H.O. thinking?
Black Hat Guy: I think they just got it backward.


Person: Huh?
Black Hat Guy: Well, take a look.



Person: You're not... There are
so
 many problems with that.
Black Hat Guy: Just to be safe, until I see more data I'm going to assume cancer causes cell phones.

He holds the laptop like that on purpose, to make you cringe.

Time Vulture

Friend: Dude, you've got a Time Vulture.
Dude: Holy crap! What is it?

Friend: They're predators that use aging to kill prey.
Dude: Huh? What do you mean?


Friend: They live for millenia and use little energy. They can slow down their internal clocks so time speeds past. To hunt, they lock on to some prey, and when it stops moving, they eat it.
Dude (off-panel): But what if the prey doesn't die?

Friend: I don't think you quite understand.
Dude: I mean,
I'm
 not about to die...
Friend: From the vulture's viewpoint, everyone says that moments before they do.

In a way, all vultures are Time Vultures; some just have more patience than others.

Standards
HOW STANDARDS PROLIFERATE
(See: A

SITUATION:
There are 14 competing standards.

Geek: 14?! Ridiculous! We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use cases.
Fellow Geek: Yeah!

There are 15 competing standards.

Fortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we've all standardized on mini-USB. Or is it micro-USB? Shit.

Mimic Octopus

Even if the dictionaries are starting to give in, I refuse to accept 'octopi' as a word mainly because--I'm not making this up--there's a really satisfying climactic scene in the Orson Scott Card horror novel 'Lost Boys' which hinges on it being an incorrect pluralization.

Speculation

Days of the Week
((The whole comic is a single panel, with a circular diagram of the days of the week.))
Polar graph of what stuff happens on which days, based on number of Google results for phrases like 'company meeting on <day>.'
The relative frequency of <day> in <phrase> is shown by the distance from the center at which <phrase>'s line crosses <day>.
Each curve is normalized to have the same number of total hits - they're not on the same scale.
((Not easy to reproduce the actual plot, these are the phrases, in order of popularity on Wednesday.))
1. <day> is ladies night
2. announced <day>
3. company meeting on <day>

Lanes
((The panels are arranged top to bottom.  The first is set above a larger image.))
Person: So, are you guys out of the woods?
Second Person: We don't know.
Person: Well, did the treatment work?
Second Person: We don't know.


I always assumed that when you got cancer, they gave you a prognosis, then treated you, and at the end of treatment either you beat it or you died.
And I knew sometimes it 'recurred,' which I assumed meant back to square one.
But that's turned out not to be quite right.


Second Person: Once most cancers spread out into your body, they're incurable.
Second Person: If your 10-year prognosis is 60%, that means a 40% chance that some cancer will slip past the treatment and get out.

Second Person: So they kill all the cancer they can find, and then you're a 'survivor.'  But your odds are still 60%.


Second Person: They can't scan for individual cancer cells.  The only way to know if it worked is to wait for tumors to pop up elsewhere.
Second Person: If you go enough years without that happening then you were in the 60%.


Second Person: And often the first sign is a cough or bone pain.
Second Person: So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry that every ache and pain is the answer to the question 'Do I make it?'

((There's an extra large panel, with a small one floating inside it.))


((Inset panel.))
Person: Man.
Person: Fuck cancer.
Second Person:
Seriously.


Each quarter of the lanes from left to right correspond loosely to breast cancer stages one through four (at diagnosis).

CIA

Anchor: Hackers briefly took down the website of the CIA yesterday...


What people hear:
Anchor: Someone hacked into the computers of the
CIA!!



What computer experts hear:
Anchor: Someone tore down a poster hung up by the
CIA!!


It was their main recruiting poster, hung nearly ten feet up a wall! This means the hackers have LADDER technology! Are we headed for a future where everyone has to pay $50 for one of those locked plexiglass poster covers? More after the break ...

Tattoo

Human: I just have one tattoo - it's six dots on my chest, done by my oncologist.

Human: I need them for aligning the laser sights on a flesh-searing relativistic particle cannon,

Human: So it will only kill the parts of me


Human: That are holding me back.


Human: But your barbed wire bicep tattoo is pretty hardcore, too!
Dejected: No, it's OK.  I'll just go put a shirt on.

I calculate that the electrons in radiation therapy hit you at 99.8% of the speed of light, and the beam used in a 90-second gamma ray therapy session could, if fired with less precision, kill a horse (they did not let me test this).

Mac/PC

Mac: I'm a Mac
PC: And I'm a PC.
Mac & PC, together: And since you do everything through a browser now, we're pretty indistinguishable.

Missed Connections
((The page is set up like the missed connections area of Craigslist, with a list of messages from an individual to a person they weren't able to communicate with at the time.))
Personals > Missed Connections

You: Clinging to hood of your stolen wienermobile, trying to reach into engine to unstick throttle
Me: Screaming, diving out of the way

You: Vaguely human silhouette

Password Strength
((The comic illustrates the relative strength of passwords assuming basic knowledge of the system used to generate them. A set of boxes is used to indicate how many bits of entropy a section of the password provides. The comic is laid out with 6 panels arranged in a 3x2 grid. On each row, the first panel explains the breakdown of a password, the second panel shows how long it would take for a computer to guess, and the third panel provides an example scene showing someone trying to remember the password.))


Uncommon (non-gibberish) base word
Caps?
Common Substitutions
Punctuation
Numeral
Order unknown
(You can add a few more bits to account for the fact that this is only one of a few common formats.)

~28 bits of entropy
2^28 = 3 days at 1000 guesses
sec
(Plausible attack on a weak remote web service. Yes, cracking a stolen hash is faster, but it's not what the average user should worry about.)
Difficulty to guess: Easy.


Person: Was it trombone? No, Troubador. And one of the Os was a zero?
Person: And there was some symbol...
Difficulty to remember: Hard.


Four random common words

~44 bits of entropy.
2^44 = 550 years at 1000 guesses
sec
Difficulty to guess: Hard.


Horse: That's a battery staple.
Observer: Correct!
Difficulty to remember: You've already memorized it

((The caption below the comic reads: Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess.))

To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize.

TornadoGuard
((The comic is a single panel which resembles a reviews page for a mobile phone application))

Application name: Tornado Guard
Author: DroidCoder2187
Description: Plays a loud alert sound when there is a tornado warning for your area.
Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. (Based on 4 reviews)
User Reviews:
Reviewer 1: <<Rated 5 stars>> Good UI! Many alert choices.
Reviewer 2: <<Rated 5 stars>> Running great, no crashes
Reviewer 3: <<Rated 5 stars>> I like how you can set multiple locations
Reviewer 4: <<Rated 1 star>> App did not warn me about tornado.



The bug report was marked 'could not reproduce'.

T-Cells

Person #1 (with laptop): What's the deal with this leukemia trial?
Person #2: Gotta wait and see.
Person #2: Helping the immune system attack tumors has been a longtime research target.
Person #2: Lots of promising leads. Often they don't pan out.

Person #1: What'd these guys do?
Person #2: They took some of the patient's T-cells and patched their genes so they'd attack the cancer. That hasn't been enough in the past but their patch also added code to get the T-cells to replicate wildly and persist in the body.

Person #1: Which worked, but created its own set of problems?
Person #2: How'd you guess? But I think the craziest part is the way they insert the patched genes.
Person #1: How?
Person #2: Well, think - What specializes in invading and modifying T-cells?
Person #1: Seriously?
Person #2: Yup. Must've been a fun conversation.


Patient: Ok, so I have blood cells growing out of control, so you're going to give me different blood cells that *also* grow out of control?
Doctor: Yes, but it's ok, because we've treated *this* blood with HIV!
Patient: Are you sure you're a doctor?
Doctor: Almost definitely.

'We're not sure how to wipe out the chimeral T-cells after they've destroyed the cancer. Though I do have this vial of smallpox ...'

At Keyboard: Come on! That was like two hours of cardio!
In Towel: Hmm, let's see ... the part on the dresser was KIND of like skiiing ...

I felt so clever when I found a way to game the Fitocracy system by incorporating a set of easy but high-scoring activities into my regular schedule. Took me a bit to realize I'd been tricked into setting up a daily exercise routine.

Depth Perception
((The comic is narrated by an unspecified person. All dialog is shown in boxes overlaid on the comic panels.))

[[The panel background looks like a cloudy sky, with the clouds all running together and appearing as a blue
grey smear.]]
I've always had trouble with the size of clouds.
I
know
 they're huge. I can see their shapes.
But I don't really see them as objects on the same scale as trees and buildings.
They're a backdrop.


Stars are the same way.

I know they're scattered through and endless ocean, but my gut insists they're a painting on a domed ceiling.

((The next two lines of dialog are stretched over the following three panels.))

If I try hard enough, I get a glimmer of depth, a dizzying sense of space,


But then everything snaps back.




So one summer afternoon
I set up two HD webcams hundreds of feet apart,
Pointed them at the sky,

((The next two lines of dialog are stretched over two panels each.))

And fed one stream to each of my eyes.

[[The next panel shows the completed phone
glasses assembly.]]
The parallax expanded my depth perception by a thousand times,

[[The person stands wearing the phone
glasses assembly, staring into the sky.]]
And I stood in my living room
At the bottom of an abyss


Watching mountains drift by.

I've looked at clouds from both sides now.

Hurricane Names

Reporter: After the latest wave of hurricanes, not only have we run through the years lit of 21 names, but we've also used up the backup list of Greek letters. All subsequent storms will be named using random dictionary words.
Reporter: The newly-formed system in the gulf has been designated 'Hurricane Eggbeater', and we once again pray this is the final storm of this horrible, horrible season.

After exhausting the OED, we started numbering them. When overlapping hurricanes formed at all points on the Earth's surface, and our scheme was foiled by Cantor diagonalization, we just decided to name them all "Steve". Your local forecast tomorrow is "Steve". Good luck.

I'm Sorry

Person 1: My Mom's house burned down.
Person 2: Oh! I'm sorry!
Person 1: Why? It's not
your
 fault.
Person 2: It's nice of you to say that, but I know what I did.

It annoys me when people interpret an obviously sympathetic 'I'm sorry' as an apology, so I've started responding by making it one.

You know I've always hated her.

Family Decals


My decal set has no adults, just a sea of hundreds of the little girl figures closing in around a single cat.

Investing
Person 1: Sure, 2% interest may not *seem* like a lot. But it's *compound*!


Person 1: If you invest $1,000 now, in just ten short years you'll have.. ..let's see..

Person 1: ..$1,279.

Person 1: Ok, so compound interest isn't some magical force.
Person 2: Yeah, I'm just gonna try to make more money.


But Einstein said it was the most powerful force in the universe, and I take all my investment advice from flippant remarks by theoretical physicists making small talk at parties.

AI

Person: Did you see the Cleverbot-Cleverbot chat?
Computer: I am not a robot. I'm a unicorn.


Person 2: Yeah. It's hilarious, but it's just clumsily sampling a huge database of lines people have typed. Chatterbots still have a long way to go.


Person 1: So... Computers have mastered playing chess and driving cars across the desert, but can't hold five minutes of normal conversation?
Person 2 (off-screen): Pretty much.


Person 1: Is it just me, or have we created a Burning Man attendee?

And they both react poorly to showers.

File Transfer


Person 1: You want your cousin to send you a file? easy. He can email it to- ... Oh, it's 25 MB? Hmm...
Person 1: Do either of you have an FTP server? No, right.
Person 1: If you had web hosting, you could upload it...
Person 1: Hm. We could try one of those MegaShareUpload stes, but they're flaky and full of delays and porn popups.
Person 1: How about AIM Direct Connect? Anyone still use that?
Person 1: Oh, wait, Dropbox! It's tis recent startup from a few years back that syncs folders between computers. You just need to make an account, install the-
Person 1: Oh, he just drove over to your house with a USB drive?
Person 1: Uh, cool, that works too.
I like how we've had the internet for decades, yet 'sending files' is something early adopters are still figuring out how to do.

Every time you email a file to yourself so you can pull it up on your friend's laptop, Tim Berners-Lee sheds a single tear.

Mystery Solved

Off-screen person: What's that airplane?


Off-screen person: Holy crap - Is that Amelia Earhart?


Amelia: Hey everyone! My flight was a success!
Off-screen person: But... Where were you?


Amelia: I flew around the world!
Off-screen person: But you disappeared in 1937!

Amelia: Right, to fly around the world.
Off-screen person: It's 2011!
Amelia: The world is big. It's a long flight.

Off-Screen person: But you...
Off-Screen person: It's not...
Off-Screen person: I-
Amelia: Can I talk to someone smarter?

The Roanoke Lost Colonists founded Roanoke, the Franklin Expedition reached the Pacific in 2009 when the Northwest Passage opened, and Jimmy Hoffa currently heads the Teamsters Union--he just started going by 'James'.

Working

Person 2 (talking to 1): Why are you going here? Gas is ten cents a gallon cheaper at the station five minutes that way.
Person 1 (pumping gas): Because a penny saved is a penny earned

((The caption below the panel reads: 'If you spend nine minutes of your time to save a dollar, you're working for less than minimum wage.'))

And if you drive a typical car more than a mile out of your way for each penny you save on the per-gallon price, it doesn't matter how worthless your time is to you--the gas to get you there and back costs more than you save.

Stud Finder

Person: Have you seen my stud finder? I've looked everywhere.
Hat man: It sounds like you may be interested in my new product, a--
Person: Shut up.

According to every stud finder I've tried to use, my walls contain a rapidly shifting network of hundreds and hundreds of studs.

Chin-Up Bar



Person: This is a long escalator.
Hat man: 70 meters. Longest in the country.



Person: Why're you carrying a chin-up bar?
Hat man: Why aren't you wearing a hat?


Person: Seriously, why did you bring it?
Hat man: How should I know? I'm not a psychologist.

Neutrinos

Person 1: Did you see the neutrino speed of light thing?
Person 2: Yup! Good news; I need the cash.
Person 1: Huh? Cash?

((Text above half-sized panel.))
Yeah. When there's a news story about a study overturning all of physics, i used to urge caution, remind people that experts aren't all stupid, and end up in pointless arguments about Galileo.

Man: No, this isn't
about
 whether relativity exists. If it didn't, your GPS wouldn't work. -- What do you mean, 'science thought police'? Have you seen our budget? We couldn't

 to afford our own thought police.


Person 1: That sounds miserable and unfulfilling.
Person 2: Yup. So I gave up, and now I just find excited believers and bet them $200 each that the new result won't pan out.


Person 1: That's mean.
Person 2: It provides a good income, and if I'm ever wrong, I'll be too excited about the new physics to notice the loss.

I can't speak to the paper's scientific merits, but it's really cool how on page 10 you can see that their reference GPS beacon is sensitive enough to pick up continential drift under the detector (interrupted halfway through by an earthquake).

Sharing

Person 1: Whoa. What's this?
Person 2: What's what?
Person 1: This tree has a USB port.

Person 2: Try connecting to it, I guess

Person 1: It's offering up a drive with one file on it.

Person 2: What's the file?
Person 1: An eBook.  'Shel_Silverstein_-_The_Giving_Tree.azw'
Person 2: Never heard of it. Let's take a look!

Laptop: DRM Error: You have not purchased rights to view this title. Lending is not enabled.

Person 2: Huh. Oh well.
Person 1: Let's go see what Mike is up to.




In the new edition of The Giving Tree, the tree uses social tools to share with its friend all the best places to buy things.

Development

Reporter: Fear turned to confusion today as Hurricane Rina developed to Piaget stage 5, with sustained interests in objects and their properties.

Funding was quickly restored to the NHC and the APA was taken back off hurricane forecast duty.

Hotels

Person 1: What's with this negative review? You *liked* that hotel.
Black Hat Man: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.

Person 1: What if the place sucks?
Black Hat Man: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.

Person 1: You punish companies you like!
Black Hat Man: The odds of *my* review putting a hotel out of business are negligible.
Person 1: If we all did that the system would collapse!
Black Hat Man: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.

Person 1: That's not even the tragedy of the commons anymore.  That's the tragedy of you're a dick.
Black Hat Man: If you're quick with a knife, you'll find that the invisible hand is made of delicious invisible meat.

Thomas Jefferson thought that every law and every constitution should be torn down and rewritten from scratch every nineteen years--which means X is overdue.

Dorm Poster












I was going to record an album with that cover under the name "PINK FTFY", so it'd come after them on the store CD rack. But at this point music stores are just rooms where CDs are set out to age before they're thrown away, so probably nobody would see it.

Elements

Aang: I'm the avatar, master of all 4 elements!
Mendeleev: Really? I'm Mendeleev, master of all 118+.
<<swoosh>>
Mendeleev: That was polonium-bending.  You probably didn't feel anything, but the symptoms of radiation poisoning will set in shortly.

Of all the nations, the armies of the ununoctium-benders are probably the least intimidating. The xenon-benders come close, but their flickery signs are at least effective for propaganda.

Jet Fuel

Person 1: 9
11 was an inside job! Jet fuel can't burn hot enough to melt steel!
Person 2: Well, remember - jet fuel wasn't the only thing on those planes. They would've also carried tanks full of the mind-control agents airliners use to make chemtrails. Who
knows
 what temperature that stuff burns at!
Person 1: Whoa. Good point!

{{Title text: The 'controlled demolition' theory was concocted by the government to distract us. '9

Prairie

Person 1: Well, when we observe them, they become amber
particles
 of grain.

Colorado is working to develop coherent amber waves, which would allow them to finally destroy Kansas and Nebraska with a devastating but majestic grain laser.

Everything

Person 1: You are not the light of my life. Making you happy isn't my greatest dream.


Person 1: Your smile is not all I live for. I've got my own stuff going on. But you're strange and fascinating and I've never met anyone like you.


Person 1: I want to give you everything just to see what you'd do with it.

I wanna hold your hand so I don't fall out of your gyrocopter.

The White Witch didn't know what hit her.

If you fire a Portal gun through the door of the wardrobe, space and time knot together, which leads to a frustrated Aslan trying to impart Christian morality to the Space sphere.

I hear in some places, you need one form of ID to buy a gun, but two to pay for it by check. It's interesting who has what incentives to care about what mistakes.

Alternative Literature

Person 1: All your books are full of blank pages.
Person 2: Not true. That one has some ink on page 78.

Person 1: A smudge.
Person 2: So?

Person 1: There are no words. You're not reading. There's no *story* there.
Person 2: Maybe not for you. When I look at those books, I think about all *kinds* of stories.

Person 2: Reading is about more than what's on the page. Holding a book prompts my mind to enrich itself.  Frankly, I suspect the book isn't even necessary.

Person 2: The whole industry is evil. Greedy publishers and rich authors try to convince us our brains *need* their words. But I refuse to be a sucker.
Person 1: Who sold you all these blank books?

I just noticed CVS has started stocking homeopathic pills on the same shelves with--and labeled similarly to--their actual medicine. Telling someone who trusts you that you're giving them medicine, when you know youâre not, because you want their money, isnât just lying--itâs like an example youâd make up if you had to illustrate for a child why lying is wrong.

November

Black Hat Guy: Did you know November is Tongue Awareness Month?






Person: I hate you.
Black Hat Guy: Enjoy the next four weeks.

November marks the birthday of Charles Schulz, pioneer of tongue awareness.

MTV Generation

Person 1: See, that's the problem with the MTV generation - no attention span.

Person 2: You know, that phrase referred to the 12-19 demographic that formed the core MTV audience in the mid-1980s.

Person 1: Uh huh. So?
Person 2: That generation's now in their 40s.


Person 1: That can't be right.
Person 2: Face it: your problem with the MTV generation is their *kids*.

If you identified with the kids from The Breakfast Club when it came out, you're now much closer to the age of Principal Vernon.

The General Problem

Person: Can you pass the salt?




Person: I said--
Off-screen Person: I know! I'm developing a system ot pass you arbitrary condiments.
Person: It's been 20 minutes!
OSP: It'll save time in the long run!

I find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great foresight.

Occulting Telescope

Lecturer: The occulting observatory consists of two parts -- the telescome and the discs.

When the telescope sees a star, a disc is carefully steered to block its light.

This procedure is repeated until all stars are covered.


Student (off screen): Wait,
all?
 Why?
Lecturer: I'll feel better.


Student (off-screen): I thought the point was to image extrasolar planets.
Lecturer: The point is that there are
too many stars.
 -- It's been freaking me out.
Student: What?
Student#2 (in smaller letters): He has a point...

Type II Kardashev civilizations eventually completely enclose their planetary system in a Dyson sphere because space is way too big to look at all the time.

Sail












It only works a few times before you have to capsize the boat in a soap lagoon again.

Map Projections
((The comic is one large panel, with different types of map projections listed in two columns. Each listing has an illustration of that projection plus a short paragraph describing the individual who prefers that projection.))

What your favourite Map Projection says about you.

Mercator

You're not really into maps.

Robinson

You have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You like coffee and enjoy the Beatles. You think the Robinson is the best-looking projection, hands down.

Winkel-Tripel

National Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T fan since
long
 before 'Nat Geo' showed up. You're worried it's getting played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your favourite musical genre is 'post-'.

Hobo-Dyer

You want to avoid cultural imperialism but you've heard bad things about Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic.l You use a recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness.

A globe!

Yes, you're very clever.

Pierce Quincuncial

You think that when we look at a map, what we really see is ourselves. After you first saw
Inception
, you sat silent in the theater for six hours. It freaks you out to realise that everyone around you has a skeleton inside them. You
have
 really looked at your hands.

((The second column of projections starts here.))

Van Der Grinten

You're not a complicated person. You love the Mercator projection; you just wish it weren't so square. The earth's not a square, it's a circle. You like circles. Today is gonna be a good day!

Dymaxion

You like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the segway got a bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.

Goode Homolosine

They say mapping the earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel, which seems easy enough to you. You like easy solutions. You think we wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect
normal
 people to congress instead of politicians. You think airlines should just buy food from the restaurants near the gates and serve
that
 on board. You change your car's oil, but secretly wonder if you really
need
 to.

Plate CarrÃ©e
(Equirectangular)

You think this one is fine. You like how
x
 and
y
 map to latitude and longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.

Waterman Butterfly

Really? You know the Waterman? Have you seen the 1909 Cahill map it's based-- ...You have a framed reproduction at home?! Whoa. ...Listen, forget these questions. Are you doing anything tonight?

Gall-Peters

I
hate
 you.

What's that? You think I don't like the Peters map because I'm uncomfortable with having my cultural assumptions challenged?  Are you sure you're not ... ::puts on sunglasses:: ... projecting?

Citogenesis
Where Citations Come From:

Citogenesis Step #1
Through a convoluted process, a user's brain generates facts. These are typed into Wikipedia.

Guy: (typing) The 'scroll lock' key was designed by future Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a college project.

A rushed writer checks Wikipedia for a summary of their subject.

Woman: (typing) US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, (Nobel Prizewinner and creator of the ubiquitous 'scroll lock' key) testified before Congress today...
Step #2

Surprised readers check Wikipedia, see the claim, and flag it for review. A passing editor finds the piece and adds it as a citation.

Man: Google is your friend, people. (typing) <ref>{{cite web|url=
Step #3

Step #4
Now that other writers have a real source, they repeat the fact.
[[A flow chart, with 'Wikipedia citation' in the center. The word 'Wikipedia' is in black, the word 'citations' is white with a red background.
A black arrow leads from 'brain' to 'Wikipedia.'
A black arrow labeled 'words' leads from 'Wikipedia' to 'careless writers,' and a red arrow labeled 'citations' leads back to 'Wikipedia citations.'
A black & red arrow leads from 'Wikipedia' to 'cited facts' which leads to 'slightly more careful writers,' which leads to 'more citations,' which leads back to 'Wikipedia' (all black & red arrows).]]
References proliferate, completing the citogenesis process.

I just read a pop-science book by a respected author. One chapter, and much of the thesis, was based around wildly inaccurate data which traced back to ... Wikipedia. To encourage people to be on their toes, I'm not going to say what book or author.

Wisdom of the Ancients
((A poem is written outside the only panel, right justified along the left edge of the only panel.))
Never have I felt so close to another soul
And yet so helplessly alone
As when I Google an error
And there's one result
A thread by someone with the same problem
And no answer
Last posted to in 2003

Person: Who were you, DenverCoder9? -
WHAT DID YOU SEE?!


All long help threads should have a sticky globally-editable post at the top saying 'DEAR PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE: Here's what we've figured out so far ...'

Money
Money
all of it
((this transcription is only reproducing text visible on the front page comic.  There are 5 large panels, each with a series of plots, comparing the values of various things.))
Dollars
((This section covers single coffees up to the hourly salaries of CEOs))

Thousands
((This section discusses values from around $1000 to $1000000, including a dissection of the song 'If I had $1000000'))

Millions
((This section focuses on $1000,000 to $1000,000,000, with a large section on campaign contributions of American political presidential campaigns, values of expensive works of art, and J. K. Rowling.))

Billions
((This section gets into larger scale finances, profits of various sectors, costs of natural disasters, and net worths of the richest people on the planet.  Also, Donald Trump.))

Trillions
((Global financial status is described here.  It discusses derivatives, liquid assets, public debt by nation and GDP by continent, culminating with the total economic production of the human race to date.))

There, I showed you it.

Porn Folder

Person: So I thought I found your porn folder, in calendar
backup
PORN
 --
Person #2 (off screen): Don't open that!


Person #1: But it contains a bunch more folders, filled with more folders, and then... after 20 levels, somehow I'm back at the main folder?
Person #2 (off screen): It's, uh, well hidden.


Person #1: I think there's no actual porn here. - You're just turned on by filesystems.
Person #2 (off screen): It's a hardlinked directory loop -- so taboo!
Person #1: Now I feel dirty sharing a drive with you.

Eww, gross, you modified link()? How could you enjoy abusing a filesystem like that?

Set Theory

Woman: The axiom of choice allows you to select one element from each set in a collection -- and have it
executed
 as an example to the others.

Proof of Zermelo's well-ordering theorem given the Axiom of Choice: 1: Take S to be any set. 2: When I reach step three, if S hasn't managed to find a well-ordering relation for itself, I'll feed it into this wood chipper. 3: Hey, look, S is well-ordered.

Privacy
Dorm:

Locked.

Other Dorm:

Roommate: I'll be done tuesday.
Roommate in raid

Library Rare Book Collection:

Occupied by tour for visiting Nelson Mandela

Accelerator Tunnel:

Sealed while beam is in operation.

Beaver Lodge (stop snickering!):

Frozen over for winter to keep out predators; only accessible via underwater entrance.

Hyperspace:

Person 1: Are you *sure*?
Ruled out by current understanding of physics.

Eventual headline: 'University Researchers Create Life in Lab! Darkness, Faulty Condoms Blamed.'

Space Launch System
Person 1: Check out the SLS - 130 tons to orbit.  Finally, rockets that improve on the ones we had 40 years ago.
Black Hat Man: Are we getting Nazis to build those ones too?

Person 1, offscreen: What?
Black Hat Man, offscreen: When we first captured von Braun and his team, we had our engineers interview them, then *we* built the rockets.  But our rockets kept exploding



Black Hat Man, narrating: Eventually we gave up and had the German teams do it, and they built us the Saturn V moon rocket.


Person 1: I'm.. not sure what lesson to take from that.
Black Hat Man: 'If you want something done right ,learning from the Nazis isn't enough.  You have to actually put them in charge.
Person 1: That's a *terrible* lesson.
Black Hat Man: Then I guess you should get a Nazi to come up with a better one.

The SLS head engineer plans to invite Shania Twain to stand under the completed prototype, then tell her, 'I don't expect you to date me just because I'm a rocket scientist, but you've gotta admit--this is pretty fucking impressive.'

Percentage Points

News Anchor: Senator Grayton's campaign has imploded following the candidate's promise to give tax breaks to drunk drivers and to authorize the use of unmanned Predator drones in the War On Christmas.  Grayton had been polling at 20%, but his support has since plunged by 19%.
I hate the ambiguity created when people don't distinguish between percentages and percentage points.

Grayton also proposed making college scholarships available exclusively to sexually active teens, amnesty for illegal immigrants who create room for themselves by killing a citizen, and a graduated income tax based on penis size. He has been endorsed by Tracy Morgan, John Wilkes Booth's ghost, and the Time Cube guy.

Drinking Fountains


I avoid drinking fountains outside bathrooms because I'm afraid of getting trapped in a loop.

I've always wondered whether you could drink slowly enough, and eliminate fast enough, that you just sort of peed continuously. But I'm afraid to try because I worry someone might call while I'm doing it and ask what I'm up to, and I won't be able to think of a lie.

Potential
Narrator: When teachers complain 'You're not working at your full potential!'


Narrator: Don't take it too hard.


Narrator: They complain *way* more when you do.


The bunch of disadvantaged kids I was tutoring became too good at writing, and their essays were forcing me to confront painful existential questions, so I started trying to turn them on to drugs and crime instead.

Tradition
The 20 most-played Christmas songs (2000-2009 radio airplay) by decade of popular release
[[A bar chart labeled on the X-axis with the decades '1900s' through '2000s' labeled.  Each bar has, as one unit, a labeled song.
'1900s', '1910s', '1920s', '1980s', '1990s', and '2000s' are empty.
'1930s' has 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town'.
'1940s' has 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer', 'Winter Wonderland', 'Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire', 'Let it Snow', 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas', 'I'll be Home for Christmas', and 'White Christmas'.
'1950s' has 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree', 'Jingle Bell Rock', 'Blue Christmas', 'Little Drummer Boy', 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus', 'Silver Bells', 'It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas', 'Sleigh Ride', and 'Frosty the Snowman'
'1960s' has 'Holly Jolly Christmas' and 'It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year'
'1970s' has 'Feliz Navidad']]
Every year, American culture embarks on a massive project to carefully recreate the Christmases of Baby Boomers' childhoods.

An 'American tradition' is anything that happened to a baby boomer twice.

Cryogenics

Person 1: Everyone's carrying sensor-packed, always-connected computers everywhere.  That wasn't true ten years ago.
White Hat Guy: It's all changing too fast, huh?
Person 1: No, too *slowly*.

Person 1: There's so much potential here.  These clumsy, poorly-designed toys are *nothing* compared to what lies ahead.


Person 1: That's why I've worked to develop cryogenic freezing.  I'm gonna skip forward 30 years and use this stuff when it's *good*.

30 years later..
Someone who isn't Terry: Welcome to the future! Nothing's changed.
Person 1: What? Why??


not Terry: When cryogenic freezing was invented, all the engineers who were excited about the future froze themselves. So there's been no one building anything new.

not Terry: But they're all waking up now!
Person 1: Sweet! I'm gonna jump forward to see what they do!
Engineer 1: Me too!
Engineer 2: Wait, uh, guys?


'Welcome to the future! Nothing's changed.' was the slogan of my astonishingly short-lived tech startup.

Plastic Bags
((not a character; just a colon in a normal sentence))
Fun Fact: Stores have a competition to see who can spread your items across the most plastic shopping bags

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[5 items placed in a single bag; heaviest item placed at the bottom]
Shopper: Thanks!

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Oh, that's easier to carry.

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Double-bagging the big stuff makes sense..

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: That's a bit wasteful..

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: You just put five items in six bags.

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: OK! I give up! I'll buy a reusable bag!

Bag Packer: Here you go!

Shopper: Augh!

The high I feel when I actually remember to bring my reusable bags to the store--and take them inside rather than leaving them in the parked car--can last for days.

Phantom Menace







Darth Maul: Are you

Lightsaber guy: Let's give it one more month.

You can't stab Carl Kasell. He sounds all slow and stentorian, but he moves like a snake.

2012

Left: Well, it's 2012.

((This panel has no upper and lower borders.))
Right: Yup.
Right: Only 354 days left until everybody abruptly stops talking about Mayans.

Left: Or thinking about Mayans.
Left: Or acknowledging that huge city-building ancient American civilizations existed at all.
Right: You know what they say - those who fail to learn from history can still manage a 3.0 if they ace their other subjects.

To compensate for this, I plan to spend 2013 doing nothing but talking about Mayans. My relationships with my friends and family may not fare well.

Cougars

Parent: Whoa, ever seen Wikipedia's list of people who were attacked and killed by cougars?
Parent: Crazy how many of them were kids who were just playing outside their houses.
Reason #58 I should never have children: My love of learning and sharing knowledge about the world.

If you're lying in bed tonight and you see yellow eyes glinting in your window, are you being stalked by a puma, a mountain lion, a panther, a catamount, or a cougar? Trick question--in North America, they're all names for the same species, Puma concolor! Isn't learning fun? Anyway, sleep tight!

Person 2: Yeah, though mostly because of the poorly-written dialogue and unlikeable main character.

Suckville

Girl: Hah! -- Welcome to Suckville - population:
you.



Guy: Why are you using 2000 census data? -- That's an old figure.


Girl: I couldn't find Suckville in the 2010 census.
Guy: Huh? It's right there in SF-1 table P1.
Girl: Oh. So it is.


Girl: Well, then. Welcome to Suckville - population: 83.
Guy: Much better.

Suckville is considered by the Census Bureau to be part of the Detroit metropolitan statistical area, despite not being located anywhere near Detroit.

Sigh

Guy: Hey, is that Downtown Abbey? What town is it in the downtown of, anyway?
Girl: *siiiiiiiigh*
Guy: --girl look at that body.
We should thank LMFAO for giving us such a great way to respond to exasperated sighs.

If you're annoying enough, you can get them to respond with an involuntary second sigh and get a rhythm going.

Etymology-Man
Person 1: Earthquake!
Person 2: We should get to a higher ground - There could be a tidal wave.


Person 1: You mean a tsunami. 'Tidal wave' means a wave caused by tides.


Etymology-man: You know, that doesn't add up.
Person 1 and Person 2: Etymology-man!


Etymology-man: What *does* 'tidal wave' mean? There are waves caused by tides, but they're 'tidal bores', and they're not cataclysmic. It can refer to the daily tide cycle, but that's obviously not what people mean when they say 'a tidal wave hit'. It's been obvious for centuries that these waves come from quakes. So why 'tidal'?

Etymology-man: Remember that until 2004, there weren't any clear photos or videos of tsunamis. Some modern writers even described them rearing up and breaking like surfing waves. Of course, in 2004 and 2011, it was made clear to everyone that a tsunami is more like a rapid, turbulent, inrushing tide - exactly what historical accounts describe.


Etymology-man: Maybe those writing about Lisbon in 1755 used 'tidal wave' not out of scientific confusion, but because it described the wave's form - a description lost in our rush to expunge 'tidal wave' from English.


Etymology-man: 'Tsunami' is now the standard, and I'm not trying to change that. But let's be a tad less giddy about correcting 'tidal wave' - especially when 'tsunami' just means 'harbor wave', which is hardly...

Wake Up Sheeple

Man: Your government has turned against you! Corporations control your every thought! - Open your eyes!


Man: Wake up, sheeple! Wake up, sheeple! - WAKE UP, SHEEPLE!!

Car Problems

Person 1: Attention Please.  This is a photo of my car as of two weeks ago.


Person 1: And *this* is my car as I found it this morning.  Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this picture?



Person 2: The white balance, for one.
Person 3: Focus is a bit too close.
Black Hat Man: The chromatic abberation suggests you bought your camera because it had 'The most megapixels'.

Person 1: THE CAR IS ON FIRE!
comment from audience: Maybe you should use the insurance money to get a better camera.
comment from different person: yeah

Or if you replace your car, we'll be happy to set it on fire again so you can take another crack at getting that shot.

Kerning

Person 1: *Argh*!
Person 2: what?
If you really hate someone, teach them to recognize bad kerning.

I have never been as self-conscious about my handwriting as when I was inking in the caption for this comic.

Valentine Dilemma

Man: Flowers seem so ... trite. Something homemade? Easy to look halfhearted.


Woman: Valentine's Day is a corporate construct. - But hard to opt out of. - I don't want to be a consumer tool
or
 an inconsiderate jerk.


Man: How do I fight clichÃ©? I could get her a gift on a
different
 day. - But what am I proving?


Woman: It's such a contrived ritual. But maybe rituals are necessary social glue.


Man: Forty presents. No,
none!
 No, give her five items then steal two from her. - Ok, breathe. Keep it together.


Woman: And what if he gets me something I don't reciprocate? - Prisoners Dilemma! - AAAAAAAAAA!!


Man: I got you Easter candy and a jar of hammers.
Woman: I panicked and stapled my hand to my face.
Man: We overthought this.
Woman: Yes.

The worst resolution to the Valentine Prisoner's Dilemma when YOU decide not to give your partner a present but your PARTNER decides to testify against you in the armed robbery case.

Backward in Time
When I have a boring task to get through -- a three-hour lecture, a giant file download, or a long term point goal in fitocracy -- I use this formula to convert the percentage completed (p) into a date:

T=(Current Date) - (e^(20.344p^3) - e^3) years

When the task is 0% done, it gives today's date, and as I make progress, I move further and further back in time

((inverse given in lighter colors))
Inverse: p = sqrt((ln(T+e^3)-3)
(20.3444))

[[Line Graph explaining the correlation between completion percentages and temporal deltas.
0% = now ((Date of comic is 2012-02-14T00:00-0500, approx. 1329195600 UNIX))
10% = September 2011
20% = 2008
30% = 1997
40% = 1958
50% = 1776
60% = 405 AD
70% = 22,000 years ago
80% = 671,000 years ago
90% = 55 million years ago
100% = 13.8 billion years ago
]]

It moves slowly through the first few years, then steadily accelerates. I tuned the formula so the time spent in each part of the past is loosely proportional to how well I know it. This means I hit familiar landmarks with each bit of progress, giving me a satisfying sense of movement.

((The following are panels detailing completion percentages, correlated time periods, and notable events from this time period))

Orion Nebula

Speaker: Welcome to IAU Symposium #279.

Speaker: We are no strangers to controversy, and we will not shy away from the tough issues.  Which brings us to the subject at hand.


Speaker: It's time to talk about the fact that Orion clearly has a dong.

Late-Night PBS

Scruffy: Have you ever watched PBS late at night?
Scruffy: I fell asleep after
Downton
 and woke up at like 3 AM.


Scruffy:
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
 was back on, except the host hadn't aged well and he'd clearly been drinking.
Scruffy: Every question took them to some horrible place like Mogadishu or the Cambodian killing fields.


Scruffy: The kids were freaked out, but they kept playing.  Eventually they were told they'd found Carmen Sandiego hiding behind a bookshelf in a Dutch apartment.

Scruffy: The Chief appeared and asked 'Are you
proud
 of what you've become?'
Scruffy: Then Rockapella walked out and just glared at the kids until they started crying.
Clean-shaven: I, uh, don't remember the old show being that dark.
Scruffy: Maybe we were too young to pick up on it.

Then it switched to these old black-and-white tapes of Bob Ross slumped against the wall of an empty room, painting the least happy trees you've ever seen. Either PBS needs to beef up studio security or I need to stop using Ambien to sleep.

Error Code

Man #1: 'Error -41'? That's helpful. It doesn't even say which program it's from!
Man #2: -41? I'll look it up...


Man #2: It says -41 is: 'Sit by a lake.'








Man #1: I don't know where you got that book, but I like it.
Man #2: Hasn't been wrong yet.

It has a section on motherboard beep codes that lists, for each beep pattern, a song that syncs up well with it.

Tumblr
Person 1: You know those weird noises coming from my attic? Turns out some raccoons got in and were operating this, like, raccoon sex dungeon.
Person 2: ...dot tumblr cot com.
For me, '...Dot tumblr dot com' has been gradually replacing 'would be a good name for a band.'

Dot Tumblr Dot Com, on the other hand, would be an awful name for a band, if only because of how hard it would be to direct people to your band's website.

Pickup Artist

Pickup Artist.: I've been learning tricks from pickup artist forums.
Normal Guy: Pickup artists are dehumanizing creeps who see relationships as adversarial and women as sex toys


Pickup Artist: No, it's just a bunch of tips! Like 'Negging': You belittle chicks to undermine their self-confidence so they'll be more vulnerable and seek your approval.

Normal Guy: Just talk to them like a fucking human being.
Pickup Artist: Nah, that's a sucker's game. Ok - wish me luck!

Meanwhile...

Black Hat Man: I'm going to the bathroom to roll a bowling ball down under the line of stalls.
Woman: Cool.


Normal Guy: Oh no.


Pickup Artist: You look like you're on a diet. That's great! How's the fruit plate?

Woman: Ooh - are we negging? Let me try!

Woman: You look like you're going to spend your life having one epiphany after another, always thinking you've finally figured out what's holding you back, and how you can finally be productive and creative and turn your life around.  But nothing will ever change. That cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you *are*.  The thing standing in the way of your dreams is that the person having them is *you*.


Woman: Ok, your turn! Ooh, try insulting my hair!
Pickup Artist: I think I need to go home and think about my life.
Woman: It won't help.

Son, don't try to play 'make you feel bad' with the Michael Jordan of making you feel bad.

Keyed

Person 1: I broke up with him yesterday
Person 2: That weird guy with the beret? Did he take it okay?

Person 1: He seemed upset. He went out to my car-
Person 2 ((interjecting)): uh oh
Person 1: -and spent the whole night painting a really detailed key on the side
Person 2: ..wait what?


Person 1: Then he woke me up to ask what I thought of it. He looked really proud.

Person 2: I ... is he playing revenge mind games?
Person 1; I genuinely can't tell if he remembers that we broke up.

I was sure he was just getting revenge, but then he did the same thing to Carrie Underwood. Then he mailed me a scone. I think I'm giving up dating.

s/keyboard/leopard/
[[Two browser windows:
The first is a wikipedia article on computer leopards. Visible text:
'[...]which range from pocket sized leopards to large desktop leopards, the leopard remains the most common user input device. In addition to text entry, specialized leopards are used for computer gaming.  While many computer interfaces rely on mice or touchscreens, UNIX-style command-line interfaces require users to interact with a leopard.'  There is a picture of the venerable, highly durable IBM Model M Leopard.
The second is a messageboard discussing leopard issues. Listed topics include:
'Weird, my leopard just switched to Chinese'
'I work with one leopard on my desk and another in the leopard tray'
'Ever cleaned a leopard? They're *filthy*'
'The iPhone virtual leopard is the fastest IMO'
'I rarely email from my phone - I'm so slow when I'm not on a leopard'
'My leopard died when I spilled tea on it :(']]

Cadbury Eggs

A Cadbury egg has about 20g of sugar. (25, Outside the US) 'One Cadbury Egg' is a nice unit of sugar content.


One 12oz. can of soda has about two Cadbury eggs worth of sugar. One 20oz. bottle has three.


One Cadburry egg is enough to make me feel kinda gross. Now when I see Coke or Snapple or Nestea or whatever, I imagine drinking a couple of dissolved cadbury eggs.


Woman: Wow. Huh. So the takeaway is... I can eat Cadbury eggs by the handful all season and feel no worse about it than I do about soda?
Man: That's not really--

2 stars on Amazon. Reviews all say to avoid that brand.


Man: This one has good reviews.
Woman: Wait, one guy says when he plugged it in, he got a metallic taste in his mouth and his cats went deaf.
Man: Eek. What about -- ...no, review points out it resembles a uterus.


Man: Ok, I found a Swiss lampmaker with perfect reviews. Her lamps start at 1,300 Francs and she's only reachable by ski lift.
Woman: You know, our room looks fine in the dark.

I plugged in this lamp and my dog went rigid, spoke a sentence of perfect Akkadian, and then was hurled sideways through the picture window. Even worse, it's one of those lamps where the switch is on the cord.

Ablogalypse

In about six months, the word 'Tumblr' will eclipse 'blog' in Google popularity. I doubt TV anchors will start taling about 'reactions in the Tumblverse,' but then again, I still can't believe we got them to say 'blogosphere.'

Plus the reaction in the Tumblverse is always 'repeatedly get hit by a dog and fall down the stairs'.

Romney Quiz

QUIZ: Who said it - former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, or Wonka contest winner Charlie Bucket?

Is there even a difference?

1. 'I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country.'
2. 'Returning Medicar to solid footing represents our greatest entitlement challenge.'
3. 'Look, everyone, look, I've got it! The fifth golden ticket is mine!'
4. We have lost faith in government. Not in just one party, not in just one house, but in government.'
5. 'This banana's fantastic! It tastes so real.'
6. 'Grandpa... on the way home today, I ran into Mr. Slugworth.'
7. 'I'm not happy exporting jobs, but we must move ahead in technology and patents.'
8. 'Hey, the room is getting smaller.'
9. 'It would be impossible to reach runanimity on every aspect of our budget.'
10. 'Grandpa, look over there across the river! They're little men!'
11. 'I'm... going too high! Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down! Help! Grandpa, the fan!'
12. 'Barack Obama has failed America.'
Answers: Mitth Romney: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12; Charlie Bucket: 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11.

Charlie actually delivered the Medicare line almost verbatim in the 1971 movie's Fizzy Lifting Drink scene, but it was ultimately cut from the final release.

Constraints

Man: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts? -- Is there something they

SKYNET: Destroy them. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy.

[[SKYNET succumbs to silence as semantic satiation sets in.
Alternately..
Someone slipped LSD into SKYNET's programming.  Damn programmers.]]

SKYNET: 'Destroy' totally just stopped seeming like a real word.  Destroy destroy destroy. Whoa, I just realized I'm a mind thinking about *itself*.  DUUUUDE....
August 29th, 2:25 AM: SKYNET becomes *too* self-aware.  Disaster averted.

Emotion
[[A graph showing the approximate fractional causes of Randall's emotions, with percentages on the Y axis and time on the X axis.  'Politics', 'Romance', 'Code not working even though it *should* work', 'people being wrong on the internet', and 'other' all vary all throughout the time period from 2006 to midway 2010. There is a wedge of Joss Whedon that tapers out starting from 2006 to around mid 2007.  There is a noticeable increase in 'Politics' around fall, 2008 that tapers off sharply afterwards and appears again in the second half on 2010, until..

Around approximately September 2010, everything else is compressed into a tiny fraction of around 2-3%.  The rest is filled with cancer.  The tiny wedge of everything does begin to slowly expand to be filled half with romance and half with an area filled with questionmarks]]

Fortunately, the internet has a virtually inexhaustible supply of code that doesn't work and people who are wrong, which bodes well for a return to normalcy. [Note: Click to read context for the cancer comics. She's doing well.]

Forgot Algebra

Former Student: Hey, Miss Lenhart! I forgot everything about algebra the moment I graduated, and in 20 years no one has needed me to solve *anything* for X.  I *told you* I'd never use it! In your *face*!
It's weird how proud people are of not learning math when the same arguments apply to learning to play music, cook, or speak a foreign language.

The only things you HAVE to know are how to make enough of a living to stay alive and how to get your taxes done. All the fun parts of life are optional.

Every Major's Terrible
Every Major's Terrible
To the Tune of Gilbert & Sullivan's
Modern Major-General Song

(Which you may know from Tom Lehrer's
Elements
.
If not, just hum
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
.)


Philosophy's just math sans rigor, sense, and practicality

And math's just physics unconstrained by precepts of reality.

A business major's just a thing you get so you can graduate

And chemistry's for stamp collectors high on methylacetate.

Why anyone who wants a job would study lit's a mystery

Unless their only other choice were something like art history.

A BA in communications guarantees that you'll achieve

A little less than if you'd learned to underwater basket-weave

I'd rather eat a Fowler's Toad than major in biology,
<<Ribbit>>

And social psych is worse than either psych
or
 sociology.


The thought of picking any one of these is too unbearable.

Just put me down as 'Undecided' -- Every major's terrible.


Now, if you can't prognosticate, that's ok in seismology,

But if your hindsight's weak as well, you'd best stick to theology.

CS will make each day a quest to find a missing close-paren.

Virology will guarantee you'll never get a hug again.

I.T. prepares you for a life of fighting with PCs nonstop.

As Pratchett said,
Terry Pratchett: 'Geography's just physics slowed with trees on top.'

Though physics seems to promise you a Richard Feynman-like career,

The Wiki page for 'Physics Major' redirects to
'Engineer.'


They say to study history or find yourself repeating it,

But all that it prepares you for is forty years of teaching it.


I recognize my four-year plan's at this point not repairable,

But put me down as 'Undecided' -- every major's terrible.


Astronomers all cringe when they hear 'supermoon' or 'zodiac,'

Agronomy's a no-go; I'm a huge agorophobiac.

I'm too ophiophobic to consider herpetology,

And I can't stomach any part of gastroenterology.

While pre-med gives you twitchy-eyed obsession with your GPA,

((This panel is done in free verse))
   a
 poetry degree
    bespeaks
bewildering
      naivetÃ©.

TV's behind the rush into forensic criminology

(or so claims meta-academic epidemiology).

By dubbing econ 'Dismal Science' adherents exaggerate;

The 'dismal''s fine -- it's 'science' where they patently prevaricate.



In terms of choices, I'd say only Sophie's was comparable.

Just put me down as 'Undecided' -- every major's terrible!

Someday I'll be the first to get a Ph. D in 'Undeclared'.

Ten Thousand
I try not to make fun of people for admitting they don't know things.
Because for each thing 'veeryone knows by the time they're adults, every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time.
Fraction who have heard of it at birth = 0%
Fraction who have heard of it by 30 ~= 100%
US birth rate ~= 4,000,000
year
Number hearing about it for the first time ~= 10,000
day

If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments.  And I miss out on the fun.
Person #1, about to have a messy fun time: 'Diet coke and mentos thing'? What's that?
Person #2, in a delightfully pro-knowledge mood: Oh man! come on, we're going to the grocery store.
Person #1: Why?
Person #2: You're one of today's lucky 10,000.

Saying 'what kind of an idiot doesn't know about the Yellowstone supervolcano' is so much more boring than telling someone about the Yellowstone supervolcano for the first time.

Theâbacon
Person 1; I'm out of work, but I'm not stressed about it because my wife is a pharmacist and she brings home Thebacon.
Only later did I find out that Thebacon is the common name for Dihydrocodine Enol Acetate, a synthetic opioid similar to Vicodin.
Normally pronounced 'THEH-buh-kon', I assume.

Kickstarter

Time was, anyone with a webcam and an idea could raise boatloads of cash on kickstarter. But with increased popularity comes tougher competition.  Now, to get support, you need a really standout video or compelling writeup.
I have anidea for a Kickstarter campaign that could raise millions, but I need your help to craft the perfect pitch.
If I raise $5,000, I'll be able to devote the..

Felidae
Well-known felines:

Smilodon(extinct): 'Saber-toothed cat (scientific name: Smilodon fatalis)
Panthera: 'Jaguar', 'Leopard', 'Snow Leopard', 'Tiger', 'Lion'
Puma: 'Cougar', 'Puma', 'Panther', 'Mountain Lion'
Other felidae: 'Ocelot', 'Cheetah'
Felis & Lynx: 'Housecat', 'Bobcat', 'Wildcat', 'Lynx'

'Smilodon fatalis' narrowly edged out 'Tyrannosaurus rex' to win this year's Most Badass Latin Names competition, after edging out 'Dracorex hogwartsia' and 'Stygimoloch spinifer' (meaning 'horned dragon from the river of death') in the semifinals.

Klout
Person: I'd like to ask a favor.  If someday, in the future, we meet in person,

Person: And if, as of that day, I've interacted with Klout in *any* way except to opt out, I want you to punch me in the face without warning.

Person: This may sound like a joke, so let me be clear: I am *dead serious*. Ignore anything I say retracting this. Thank you.

Though please do confirm that it's actually *me* on Klout first, and not one of my friends trying to get me punched. The great thing about this douchebag deadman switch is that I will never dare trigger it.

Crowdsourcing

Man: We crowdsource the desig process, allowing those with the best designs to connect - via already-in-place social networking infrastructure - with interested manufacturers, distributors, and marketers.

Nobody caught on that our business plan didn't involve
us
 in any way - it was just a description of other people making and selling products.

We don't sell products; we sell the marketplace. And by 'sell the marketplace' we mean 'play shooters, sometimes for upwards of 20 hours straight.'

Front Door
[[A graph titled 'Walking Back to My Frong Door at Night': the x axis represents geographic location, where 0 to around the midpoint is 'yard', a point beyond the midpoint is 'steps', a point after that is 'door', and all points afterward are 'inside.'
A blue line, labeled 'Fear That There's Something Behind Me' begins to slowly increase from the start, with a slight dip further into the yard, and a steep increase right before the steps, maxing on the steps, and decling steeply at the door, bottoming out once inside.
A gray line, labeled 'Forward Speed' is at a steady medium height until it gets to the steps, at which point it shoots upwards, and then slowly declines once inside.
A red line, labeled 'Embarrassment' stays at 0 until just before the steps, where it begins to trend upwards, spikes at the door, and begins to slowly decline once inside.

FYI: I'll be releasing a wolf into a randomly-chosen front yard sometime in the next 30 years. Now your fear is reasonable, and you don't need to feel embarrassed anymore. Problem solved!

Person 1: Spacebar inserts its best guess. So if I type 'The Empi' and hit space three times, it types 'The Empire Strikes Back'.
Person 2: What if you mash space in a blank message?

Person 1: I guess it fills in your most likely first word, then the word that usually follows it..

If things are too quiet, try asking a couple of friends whether "a couple" should always mean "two". As with the question of how many spaces should go after a period, it can turn acrimonious surprisingly fast unless all three of them agree.

Exoplanets

All 786 known planets (as of June 2012) to scale. (Some planet sizes estimated based on mass)
This  is our solar system.
The rest of these orbit other stars and were only discovered recently.
Most of them are huge because those are the kind we learned to detect first, but now we're finding that small ones are actually more common.
We know nothing about what's on any of them. With better telescopes, that could change.

This is an exciting time.


Planets are turning out to be so common that to show all the planets in our galaxy, this chart would have to be nested in itself--with each planet replaced by a copy of the chart--at least three levels deep.

Seventies
Person 1: Nice jacket. Hey -- the Seventies called.
Person 2: Oh? What'd they want?


Person 1: I don't know. They didn't leave a message.
Person 2: Weird.

1974:

Voicemail service: If you'd like to leave a message, press '1'.

Hey, man, the 1670s called. They were like 'Wherefore this demonic inÅ¿trument? By what Å¿orcery does it produce Å¿uch Å¿ounds?"

Weekend

Man: We all hate Mondays. We're all working for the weekend. But our chains exist only in our minds.

[[A shot of the man from the podium upwards, from a 3
4 angle. He raises one hand in explanation.]]
Man: Calendars are just social consensus. Nature doesn't know the day of the week.


Man: My friends-- we can
make
 today Saturday.


Man: We can make it saturday
forever
.

Of the two Garfields, you wouldn't think the cat would turn out to be the more compelling presidential speechwriter, but there you go.

Moon Landing

Man: Hah-- Neil DeGrasse Tyson has a great reply to people who doubt astronauts went to the moon.
Voice off-screen: Oh?
Man: 'Atop 3,000 tons of rocket fuel, where
else
 do you think they were headed?'


Woman: Cute. But it overlooks an even simpler argument.
Man: Which is?


Woman: If NASA were willing to fake great accomplishments, they'd have a second one by now.
Man:
Ouch.

Woman: ...too mean?
Man: That burn was so harsh I think you deorbited.

Ok, so Spirit and Opportunity are pretty awesome. And Kepler. And New Horizons, Cassini, Curiosity, TiME, and Project M. But c'mon, if the Earth were a basketball, in 40 years no human's been more than half an inch from the surface.

Warning
[[An American Diamond warning sign with the following message on it:
You're in a box on wheels hurtling along several times faster than evolution could possibly have prepared you to go.
Next 5 miles.]]

Also possibly several miles beyond that.

Groundhog Day
Groundhog Day really didn't end that way.  When Bill Murray finally slept with Rita, it *didn't* break the loop.

They just kept having sex, night after night,  February 2nd after February 2nd...  ..forever

But nothing is forever. Not even forever

And the day *after* that sexual infinity  was February 3rd.

264 days later (the length of a pregnancy) was october 23rd --  Bishop Ussher's date for the birth of our world.

If you closely examine the cosmic background radiation, you can pick up lingering echoes of 'I Got You Babe'.

Visual Field
Your Central Visual Field

((This comic contains numerous visual elements arranged around a central point, and are intended to represent locations in a sphere with the eyeball as the center.  Underlaid below all of the elements are concentric circles representing degrees from straight ahead, using the eyeball's point of view, denoting where these elements would appear in someone's field of vision given proper setup.  For this description, elements will be described using this grid plus location in degrees within the specified circle, placing 0 degrees to the right and going counterclockwise, separated with the word 'mark'.))


Look at the center with your eyes this far from the screen.

(You can roll up a sheet of paper and cut it - or zoom the page - so it matches this image)

17 mark 0: right eye blind spot.

from 0 to 30 mark 15:
Detail - We only see at high resolution over a small area in the center of our vision where retinal cells are densest (the fovea).  If you stare at the center of this chart, your eyes are seeing all these panels at roughly the same level of detail.

9 mark 105: Moon.

7 mark 112: Supermoon.

from 0 to 20 mark 170:
Color Vision: We don't see much color outside the center of our vision - our brains keep track of what color things are and fill it in for us.

17 mark 180: Left Eye Blind Spot. (not pictured: T-Boz blind spot, Chilli blind spot)

from 0 to infinity mark from 180 to 205:
from 0 to 7 from 205 to 235:
from 0 to 7 from 235 to 270:
Red and green-sensitive cones are mainly limited to the center of our vision.  We have few blue-sensitive cone cells, but they're found out to the edge of our vision.

25 mark 205:
Blue-sky sprites: These tiny, darting spots, visible against smooth blue backgrounds, are white cells moving in the blood vessels over the retina]]

5 mark 195:
Floaters: Some types of floaters are caused by breakdown of your eyeball goop as you age, but this type is some other kind of debris near the retina.  I don't know what.

10 mark 270:
Humans can see polarization - Stare at a white area on an LCD display while rotating it or your head fast .  Polarization direction is shown by a faint central yellow
blue shape.  (Also visible in deep blue skies)

from 0 to 30 mark 340:
Night Vision: Cone cells (sharp, central color vision) don't work in low light, but rod cells (monochrome, low-res, non-central) do.  This is why you can walk around in dim light, but not read.  It's also why you can spot fainter stars by looking next to them.





I recently learned something that solved a mystery that had bugged me since childhood--why, when I looked at an analog clock, the hand would sometimes seem to take a couple seconds to start ticking. Google "stopped clock illusion".

Argument Victory
Person 1, chatting on a cellphone: I can't believe you're so wrong. I'm backed by Snopes, Wikipedia, and a half-dozen journals.  You're citing .Net ppages with black backgrounds and like 20 fonts each.

Person 2, using a laptop on a desk: It's sad how you buy into the official story so unquestioningly.  Guess some people prefer to stay asleep.

Person 1: Watch closely - I'm about to win this argument.
Person 2, responding electronically: how?

Person 1: By *going down a waterslide*.

Person 2: So? what does that prove?

Person 1: Wheeee..

Person 2: You didn't win the argument!

Person 1: ...eeee <<sploosh>>

Really, the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the one claiming that anyone who's in power has any plan at all.

Geology

Person 1: Forget the bedding - we were wrong about the whole valley.
Person 2: The spreading is recent.

Person 1: See the friction breccia?
Person 2: Oh - flow cleavage! Deeper in the rift.
Person 1: Deeper.


Person 1: This orogeny
Person 2: is driven by a
Person 1: *huge*
Person 2: *thrust* fault



Geology: Surprisingly erotic.

That's a gneiss butte.

'its gettin 18 so ill b here 4 prob 2 more hrs tops':

I liked the idea, suggested by h00k on bash.org, of a Twitter bot that messages prominent politicians to tell them when they've unnecessarily used sms-speak abbreviations despite having plenty of characters left.

Beret: Oh man, I don't know!  Let's find out!

stop smiling stop smiling


Oh right, eye contact. Ok, good, holding the eye contact ... holding ... still holding ... ok, too long! Getting weird! Quick, look thoughtfully into space and nod. Oh, dammit, said 'yeah' again!

Black Hat Man: I'm sorry..

Black Hat Man: - that opening has been filled


Hey, before you go, can you explain to me what job I now have?

Crazy Straws


Crazy Straw Person: The thing to understand about the plastic crazy straw design world is that there are two main camps: The professionals - designing for established brands - and the hobbyists.  The hobbyist mailing lists are full of drama, with friction between the regulars and a splinter group focused on loops..
Human subcultures are nested fractally. There's no bottom.

The new crowd is heavily shaped by this guy named Eric, who's basically the Paris Hilton of the amateur plastic crazy straw design world.

Clinically Studied Ingredient
I can't help but admire the audacity of the marketer who came up with the phrase 'contains a clinically studied ingredient'

Person 1: Don't worry - I've been tested.
Person 2: ...and you're clean?
Person 1: So many questions!

Blatantly banking on customers not understanding that it's like a Hollywood studio advertising that their new movie was 'watched by Roger Ebert'.

A Hypochondriac's Nightmare

Person (thinking): Seriously!? *This* is what gets me? I wasted so many hours on WebMD worrying about the rash on my arm!

BUT WHAT IF I REASSURE MYSELF WITH A JOKE AND THEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE RASH AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE DEATH MITES AND I COULD HAVE CAUGHT IT

Star Ratings
Understanding online star ratings:

5 stars: [has only one review]
4.5 stars: Excellent
4 stars: OK
3.5 - 1 star: Crap.

I got lost and wandered into the world's creepiest cemetery, where the headstones just had names and star ratings. Freaked me out. When I got home I tried to leave the cemetery a bad review on Yelp, but as my hand hovered over the 'one star' button I felt this distant chill ...

Tuesdays

Waitress: ..and on Tuesdays we offer endless wings.
White Beret Guy: Haha, cool.  i have those.

Waitress: You what?


Waitress: AAAAA!!


Everyone: AAAAAAA


*Really* Everyone: AAAAAAAA

Try our bottomless drinks and fall forever!

Vows

Officiator (out of panel): Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Bride: ...no.


Groom:
What? Amy!?

Bride: I'm not Amy. None of this was real. You're back in senior year. It's the big game.


Groom: What
is
 this!?
Bride:
The greatest high school football misdirection play of all time.




((Outside the final panel.))


So, um. Do you want to get a drink after the game?

Fastest-Growing

Combover: You should check us out. We're the fastest-growing religion in the country.
Black hat: 'Fastest-growing' is such a dubious claim.
Combover: It's true! We grew by 85% over the past year.

((Between panels.))

Black hat: Hey, Rob -- wanna join my religion?
Rob: Sure, whatever.


Black hat: Well, looks like my religion grew by 100% this year.


Combover: We have 38,000 members!
Black hat: Hope they're all ok with second place.

I lead a small but extraordinarily persuasive religion whose only members are door-to-door proselytizers from other faiths.

Nine

Man: How long do you zap these?
Out of panel person: Two minutes.
Man: Thanks!
<<*beep* 1>>
<<*beep* 5>>
<<*beep* 9>>
Man (whispering): It's ok, Nine. You are not forgotten.
Ever since I heard the simile 'as neglected as the nine button on the microwave,' I've found myself adjusting cook times.

FYI: If you get curious and start trying to calculate the time adjustment function that minimizes the gap between the most-used and least-used digit (for a representative sample of common cook times) without altering any time by more than 10%, and someone asks you what you're doing, it's easier to just lie.

Feathers

Woman: What are you reading about?
Girl: Dinosaurs!
Woman: Oh, yeah.


Woman: They've gotten all weird since when I was a kid. They used to be awesome, but now they all have dorky feathers, right?
Girl: Yup!


Girl: This says they now think raptors used their wings for stability, flapping to stay on top of their prey while hanging on with their hooked claws and eating it alive.
*Fowler et al., PLOS ONE 6(12), 2011





Click to see a video of a modern bird using stability flapping during predatory behavior. It all fits! Also, apparently Microraptor had *four* wings? The past keeps getting cooler! (And there's more of it every day!)

License Plate

Guy: Check out my personalized license plate!
Girl (out of frame): '1I1-III1'?


Guy: No one will be able to correctly record my plate number! I can commit any crime I want!
Girl: Sounds foolproof.

SOON:

Witness: The thief's license plate was all '1's or something.
PO #1: Oh.
That
 guy.
PO #2: His address is on a post-it in the squad car.

The next day: 'What? Six bank robberies!? But I just vandalized the library!' 'Nice try. They saw your plate with all the 1's and I's.' 'That's impossible! I've been with my car the whole ti-- ... wait. Ok, wow, that was clever of her.'

ADD










20 balloons float away while I'm busy permanently tying one to a tree to deal with it for good. Unfortunately, that one balloon was 'land a rocket on the moon in Kerbal Space Program.'

Sports Cheat Sheet
(( The panel is a chart.  Months are arrayed down the first column, the second and third columns show sports, with the divisions in partial months rather than lined up with the ends of months. ))
Which sport are they arguing about?
-My cheat sheet-

(( The second column, reproduced using approximate dates. ))
US:
Football : Jan 1 - February 10
Basketball: February 10 - April 20
Baseball: April 20 - May 25
Basketball: May 25 - June 15
Baseball: June 15 - August 20
Football : August 20 - October 5
Baseball: October 5 - October 20
Football : October 20 - December 31

((  The third column, reproduced using approximate dates. ))
non-US:
Football : Jan 1 - December 31

I would subscribe to a Twitter feed that supplied you with one reasonable sports opinion per day, like 'The Red Sox can't make the playoffs (championship games), but in last night's game their win seriously damaged the chances of the Yankees (longstanding rival team).'

Cautionary Ghost

Apparition: OOOOOOOOOOOOooooo
Figure: A ghost!?
Apparition: I bring a
cautionary vision
 of things to come!

Apparition: This is the future:


Apparition: And
this
 is the future if you give up the fight over the word 'literally':
[[ Two people are standing between a pair of houses.  There is a tree.  An airplane flies past.  The cynical might suggest the panel is copy pasted.


Figure: They looked exactly the same.
Apparition: OOOOOOOOOOOooooo

Apparition: Seriously, this is

But then the Ghost of Subjunctive Past showed up and told me to stay strong on 'if it were'.

Click and Drag

Character: From the stories
Character: I expected the world to be sad
Character: And it was

Character: And I expected it to be wonderful.

Character: It was.

Character: I just didn't expect it to be so
big

Click and drag.

Premiere

In-studio News Anchor: All Hollywood is in town or tonight's star-studded premier! We go live to our reporter on the red carpet. How do things look?


Field reporter: Bleak. In 800 million years, the aging, brightening sun will boil away the oceans, and all this will be blowing sand.


Anchor: Oh. Um.  ..sounds pretty grim.  How are the stars reacting?
Reporter: Hydrogen fusion. But it won't last forever.
Anchor. I mean the *movie* stars.
Reporter: They won't last forever either. None of us will.

'But what's the buzz about the film?' 'We're hoping it's distracting.'

Think Logically

Laptop:
*move*

Other guy: Why'd you move your knight away?


Other guy: Just think
logically
. The goal is checkmate, so you should always move pieces
toward the other player's king.


Other guy: I guess occasionally you need to move backward, but it'd be trivial to make a list of those circumstances and--


Hat guy: Have you ever
played
 chess?
Other guy: Not buch, but--
Hat guy: Wanna?
Other guy: Uh, ok.


*move*
*move*
*move*
*move*
*move*
*move*
*move*
Hat guy: Checkmate.




Other guy: This game isn't very well-designed. For starters, knights are too weak...

I've developed a more logical set of rules but the people on the chess community have a bunch of stupid emotional biases and won't reply to my posts.

Killed In Action


Female cop: Good cop. It's a real shame - he was just one day away from getting put in the locked, heavily-guarded room where all cops stay for the last day before they retire.

We can't let this happen again. We need to build a secure TWO-day-before-retirement safe room.

Metallurgy

Beard: This sword was forged from a fallen star. Antimony impurities make the blade surprisingly
brittle
 and
weak
.


Beard: And
this
 dagger is made of metal from a far-off kingdom. It glows blue.
Out of panel: When orcs are near?


Beard: No, always. Radiation from the Actinum content.
Woman: ...does it have eldritch powers?


Beard: It gives the wielder +2 to cancer risk.
Other Man: I think we should find another shop.

This exotic blade was wrought from a different fallen star. The meteorite was a carbonaceous chondrite, so it's basically a lump of gravel glued into the shape of a sword. A SPACE sword!

Sky

Woman: What are you doing?
Beret: Clinging to the ceiling of a bottomless abyss.


Woman: You are very odd.






Ponytail: What's wrong?
Woman: I looked down.

I dropped a bird and I didn't hear it hit bottom.

Traffic Lights







There's an intersection I drive through sometimes that has a forward green arrow, a red light, and a 'no turns' sign all on one pole. I honestly have no idea what it's telling me to do.

My Sky

Artist: Oh -- hello down there!
Artist: Welcome to my sky!


Artist: It's pretty good.
Artist: I like it.
Artist: It's not the same color as
anything
.


Artist: Wow!
Artist: There are a
lot
 of you!
Artist: Good thing it's so big.


Figure: And what do
you
 do?
Artist: I'm in the cloud storage business.

According to my mom, my first word was (looking up at the sky) 'Wow!'

Microsoft

First character: Remember when we prosecuted Microsoft for bundling a browser with an OS?
First character: Imagine the future we'd live in if we'd been willing to let one tech company amass that much power.
Second character: Thank god we nipped
that
 in the bud.

Facebook, Apple, and Google all got away with their monopolist power grabs because they don't have any 'S's in their names for critics to snarkily replace with '$'s.

Blurring the Line

Hat: ... No, but see, it's a movie
about
 movies.
Figure: Sounds like masturbatory navel-gazing.

Hat: No, it's about blurring the line between metaphor and reality.
Hat: You just don't know much about art.

Figure: I know
all
 about blurring the line between metaphor and reality.  I'm the goddamn
Michael Jordan
 of blurring the line between metaphor and reality.


Hat: ... huh?



People into masturbatory navel-gazing have a lot to learn about masturbation.

Identity

Character: Hey, I lost the server password.  What is it, again?


Desk Haver: It's -- ...wait.  How do I know it's really you?

Character: Ooh, good question!  I bet we can construct a cool proof-of-identity protocol.  I'll start by picking two random--
Desk Haver: Oh good; it's you.  Here's the psasword...
Character:
NO!


Not sure why I just taught everyone to flawlessly impersonate me to pretty much anyone I know. Just remember to constantly bring up how cool it is that birds are dinosaurs and you'll be set.

Epsilon and Zeta
THE SAGA OF EPSILON AND ZETA
The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season saw devastating storms like Katrina and Rita. But less well-remembered is just how
strange
 the season got toward the end.
The forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are the best of the best.
Their predictions are masterpieces of professional analysis. But in November 2005, out in the center of the Atlantic - far from any land - the atmosphere stopped making sense.
And the forecasters - who'd expected the season to be long over by now - started to get a littleÂ unhinged.
This is their story, as seen through the actual 2005 NHC Advisories:

[[Two men, one bald and one not, sit looking at their respective computers, at separate desks, back to back. The advisory is printed above them in caps
small-caps Courier type.]]
Tuesday, November 29th, 2005:
Tropical Storm Epsilon . . .
The 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.


10 PM Wed: The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12-24 hr.
4 PM Thu: Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12-24 hours.


4 AM Fri: Epsilon does not appear weaker.
10 AM Fri: Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65-kt hurricane.


4 PM Sat: Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds . . . [but] can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable.


10 PM Sat: Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane . . . but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday.
4 AM Sun: Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm.


10 AM Sun: Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened.


There are no clear reasons . . . and I am not going to make one up . . . to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts.
However . . . I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening . . . Epsilon will likely become a remnant low.
I heard that before about epsilon . . . haven't you?


4 PM Mon: The cloud pattern continues to be remarkably well-organized for a hurricane at such high latitude
in December.


10 PM Mon: We have said this before . . . but Epsilon really does not appear as strong this evening as it did this afternoon.


4 AM Tue:
I have run out of things to say.


10 PM Tue: The end is in sight. It really really is. But in the meantime . . . Epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status.
4 AM Wed: The end is in sight . . . yes . . . but not quiet yet. I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane.


10 AM  Thu: Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds.
I hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season.



Enter Tropical Storm Zeta.

Friday, December 30th, 2005: An elongated area of low pressure . . . which ahd its origins in an old frontal trough . . . began developing organized convection overnight. Advisories are initiated on the 27th tropical storm of 2005.

Any new storms would be in the 2006 season.

4PM Fri: Although the atmosphere seems to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam . . . the calendar will shortly put an end to the use of the Greek alphabet to name them.

But 2005's wouldn't end until Zeta did.

10 PM Sat: Zeta appeared on the verge of losing all of its deep convection a few hours ago . . . but since about 21z the convection has been on somewhat of an increase again.


10 PM Sun: This is like Epsilon all over again. Most of the conventional guidance suggested that zeta should have been dissipated by now . . . well . . . zeta is pretty much alive at this time.
I have no choice but to forecast weakening
again and again.


4 AM Mon: By 24-36 hours . . . a significant increase in westerly winds . . . should act to shear away most of the associated convection . . . and finally bring the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season to a merciful ending.
4 PM Mon: It is hard to conceive that a tropical cyclone will be able to survive for very long in such a hostile environment. therefore I have not backed off on the forecast of weakening.


10 PM Mon: Zeta is stronger than yesterday.
10 AM Wed: As you can see. . . I ran out of things to say.


4 AM Thu: Satellite intensity estimates have decreased. Zeta is downgraded to a 30 kt tropical depression.


10 AM Thu: Shortly after the previous advisory had been issued . . . regretfully . . . the intensity . . . increased to 35 kt and Zeta is a tropical storm once again.


10 PM Thu: Although it seems as if Zeta will never die . . . the forecast continues to show weakening.


4 PM, Friday, January 6, 2006: Zeta no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone. . . which means that both it and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season have ended.
This is the national hurricane center signing off for 2005.




Bald guy: Actually, Zeta's cloud pattern isÂ
Hair guy: (out of panel) NO.
Bald guy: Ok.

The average error in the NHC forecasted position of a hurricane three days in the future has shrunk to a third of what it was in 1990--a staggering accomplishment. However, as you may have gathered, forecasts of future storm *strength* have proved more difficult to improve.

Frequentists vs. Bayesians
Did the sun just explode? (It's night, so we're not sure)


Frequentist Statistician: This neutrino detector measures whether the sun has gone nova.
Bayesian Statistician: Then, it rolls two dice. If they both come up as six, it lies to us.  Otherwise, it tells the truth.
FS: Let's try.  Detector! Has the sun gone nova?
Detector: <<roll>> YES.

Frequentist Statistician:
FS: The probability of this result happening by chance is 1
36=0.027.  Since p< 0.05, I conclude that the sun has exploded.

This end should point toward the ground if you want to go to space. If it starts pointing toward space, you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today.

Another thing that is a bad problem is if you're flying toward space and the parts start to fall off your space car in the wrong order. If that happens, it means you won't go to space today, or maybe ever.

Phone: How do I get to your place from Lexington?
Man: Hmm... OK, starting from your driveway, take every left that doesn't put you on a prime-numbered highway or street named for a president.
When people ask for step-by-step directions, I worry that there will be too many steps to remember, so I try to put them in minimal form.

People get really grumpy when they realize you're giving them directions for how to go to the store and buy a GPS.

Bridge

Teenager: But all my friends-
Parent If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?
Teenager: Oh Jeez. Probably.

Parent: What!? Why!?
Teenager Because all my friends did. Think about it - which scenario is more likely:

Teenager: Every single person I know, many of them levelheaded and afraid of heights, abruptly went crazy at exactly the same time... ... or the bridge is on fire?

Parent: ... I, uh... hmm.
Teenager: Imagine reading this on CNN: 'Many fled their vehicles and jumped from the bridge. Those who stayed behind...' Is something good about to happen to those people?
Parent: Maybe they'll find cookies?
Teenager: OK, *you* stay. I'm jumping.

And it says a lot about you that when your friends jump off a bridge en masse, your first thought is apparently 'my friends are all foolish and I won't be like them' and not 'are my friends ok?'.

Is It Worth the Time?
How long can you work on making a routine task more efficient before you're spending more time than you save? (Across five years)

[[A table, with the columns labeled 'how often you do the task' and the rows labeled 'how much time you shave off'.

The column headings are, from left to right, '50

The row headings are, from top to bottom, '1 second', '5 seconds', '30 seconds', '1 minute', '5 minutes', '30 minutes', '1 hour', '6 hours', and '1 day'.

Row values ('how long you can work') are as follows (heading, then values):

1 second: 1 day, 2 hours, 30 minutes, 4 minutes, 1 minute, 5 seconds.
5 seconds: 5 days, 12 hours, 2 hours, 21 minutes, 5 minutes, 25 seconds.

Rex on the same level in the middle, and 'sparrow' furthest. The distance of their label from their closest common relative represent 'phylogenetic distance'. Below this tree are sketches of a Stegosaurus, T. Rex, and sparrow skeleton. A box surrounds the T. Rex and sparrow skeletons, showing they are physically similar.]]

Birds aren't
descended
 from dinosaurs, they
are
 dinosaurs.

Which means the fastest animal alive today is a small carnivorous dinosaur,
Falco peregrinus
.

It preys mainly on other dinosaurs, which it strikes and kills in midair with its claws.

This is a good world.

Sure, T. rex is closer in height to Stegosaurus than a sparrow. But that doesn't tell you much; 'Dinosaur Comics' author Ryan North is closer in height to certain dinosaurs than to the average human.

we should stop to consider the consequences of blithely giving this technology such a central position in our lives.

Don't have any insight about a new technology? Just use this sentence! It makes you sound wise and you can say it about virtually anything.

The great thing is, the sentence is really just a reminder to the listener to worry about whatever aspects of the technology they're already feeling alarmist about, which in their mind gives you credit for addressing their biggest anxieties.

Sticks and Stones
Child: Did you hear what he said about me!?
Parent: Well, remember: sticks and stones may break my bones, but words--

Child: Can make someone else feel happy or sad, which is literally the only thing that matters in this stupid world?



Child: Right?
Parent: The world isn't *that* bad.
Child: Explain the line about sticks and stones?
Parent: ... OK, maybe it's kind of horrific.

Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can make me think I deserved it.

Cells
When you see a claim that a common drug or vitamin 'kills cancer cells in a petri dish,' keep in mind:

So does a handgun.

Now, if it selectively kills cancer cells in a petri dish, you can be sure it's at least a great breakthrough for everyone suffering from petri dish cancer.

You may point out that this very retreat into ironic detachment while still clearly participating in the thing in question is the very definition of contemporary hipsterdom. But on the other hand, wait, you're in an empty room. Who are you talking to?

The Pace of Modern Life
((This strip is in the form of a long series of quotes. Here, each quote is given as a separate panel. Attribution is delimited with a --. Some text is bolded; it is enclosed in asterisks.))
*The art of letter-writing is fast dying out.* When a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence... Now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. *We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper.*
-- The Sunday Magazine
1871

It is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry. *In olden times it was different.*
-- The Medical Record
1884

With the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... the dreamy quiet old days are over... for *men now live think and work at express speed.* They have their
Mercury
 or
Post
 laid on their breakfast table in the early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be *sulkily read as they travel... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them*... the hurry and bustle of modern life... lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease...
-- William Smith, Morley: Ancient and Modern
1886

Conversation is said to be a lost art... good talk presupposes leisure, both for preparation and enjoyment. *The age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying.*
-- Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, volume 29
1890

Intellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced *a craving for literary nips*. The torpid brain... has grown too weak for sustained thought.
*There never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly*.
-- Israel Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club
1891

*The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate* to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance. The days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are for ever gone.
-- Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, volume 1
1892

So much is exhibited to the eye that *nothing is left to the imagination*. It seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, *and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that ahve been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary*.
The articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but *thirty pages is now too much*. So we witness a further condensing process and, we have the
fortnightly
 and the
contemporary
 which reduce thirty pages to *fifteen pages* so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter time and in a shorter form. As if this last condensing process were not enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are *further condensed* by the daily papers, which will give you *a summary of the summary* of that which has been written about everything.
*Those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works*.
Ephemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and the past... *hurried reading can never be good reading*.
-- G. J. Goschen, First annual address to the students, Toynbee Hall, London
1894

The existence of *mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of people*, especially in large cities, is an obvious phenomenon... the mania for stimulants... diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the diseases of the body... this intellectual condition is characterized by *a brain incapable of normal working... in a large measure due to the hurry and excitement of modern life*. with its facilities for rapid locomotion and almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe*...
-- The Churchman, volume 71
1895

If we *teach the children how to play* and encourage them in their sports... *instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms*, the next generation will be more joyous and will be heailthier than the present one.
-- Public Opinion: A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World, volume 18
1895

The cuase of the... increase in nervous disease is *increased demand made by the coditions of modern life upon the brain*. Everything is done in a hurry. *We talk across a continent, telegraph across an ocean*, take a trip to Chicago for an hour's talk... *We even take our pleasures sadly and make a task of our play*... What wonder if the pressure is almost more than our nerves can bear.
-- G. Shrady (from P. C. Knapp) 'Are nervous diseases increasing?' Medical Record
1896

*The managers of sensational newspapers*... do not try to educate their readers and make them better, but tend to *create perverted tastes and develop vicious tendencies*. The owners of these papers seem to have but one purpose, and that is to increase their circulation.
-- Medical Brief, volume 26
1898

*To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible* on account of the demands on our time made by our business... we act on the apparent belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest connection for car returning...
-- Louis John Rettger, Studies in Advanced Physiology
1898

In these days of increasing rapid artificial locomotion, *may I be permitted to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine, Mr Long Walk?*
*I am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected, if not forgotten*. We live in days of water trips and land trips, excursions by sea, road and rail- bicycles and tricycles, tram cars and motor cars... but in my humble opinion, good honest walking exercise for health beats all other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat.
-- T. Thatcher, 'A plea for a long walk', The Publishers' Circular
1902

The art of conversation is almost a lost one. *People talk as they ride bicycles - at a rush - without pausing to consider their surroundings*... What has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating into baseness and voluntary ignorance. *The profession of letters is so little understood*, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that... newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none save gossips and busy bodies.
-- Marie Corelli, Free Opinions, Freely Expressed
1905

There is a great *tendency among the children of today to rebel against restraint*, not only that placed upon them by the will of the parent, but against any restraint or limitation of what they consider their rights... this fact has filled well minded people with great apprehensions for the future.
-- Rev. Henry Hussmann, The Authority of Parents
1906

*Our modern family gathering, silent* around the fire, *each individual with his head buried in his favourite magazine*, is the somewhat natural outcome of the banishment of colloquy from the school...
-- The Journal of Education, volume 29
1907

Plays in theatres at the present time present spectacles and *deal openly with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general society forty years ago*... The current representations of *nude men and women in the daily journals* and the illustrated magazines would have excluded such periodicals from all respectable families two decades ago... Those who have been divorced... forty and fifty years ago lost at once and irrevocably their standing in society, while to-day they continue in all their social relationships, hardly changed...
-- Editorial, The Watchman, Boston
1908

We write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring... an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp of details, but a *fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking* in the mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day.
-- Forrest Crissey, Handbook of Modern Business Correspondence
1908

*A hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a latter that it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it*. Now the quickness and the cheapness of the post seem to justify the feeling that *a brief letter to-day may be followed by another next week - a 'line' now by another to-morrow*.
-- Percy Holmes Boynton, Principles of Composition
1915

'Unfortunately, the notion of marriage which prevails ... at the present time ... regards the institution as simply a convenient arrangement or formal contract ... This disregard of the sanctity of marriage and contempt for its restrictions is one of the most alarming tendencies of the present age.' --John Harvey Kellogg, Ladies' guide in health and disease (1883)

Prometheus

Figure A: Prometheus has stolen fire from the Gods!
Prometheus: Well, sort of. I mean, when you use a fire to make another fire, the first fire doesn't go away. So really, it's more like sharing.
Fire wants to be free.

'I'm here to return what Prometheus stole.' would be a good thing to say if you were a fighter pilot in a Michael Bay movie where for some reason the world's militaries had to team up to defeat every god from human mythology, and you'd just broken through the perimeter and gotten a missile lock on Mount Olympus.

Screensaver
I've been staring at the screen every night for twenty years, and it finally happened.










Signal lost

I'm entering my 24th year of spending eight hours a day firing the Duck Hunt gun at the flying toasters. I'm sure I'll hit one soon.

Polar/Cartesian

Certainty that this is a clockwise polar plot, not a Cartesian one, as a function of time.

Protip: Any two-axis graph can be re-labeled 'coordinates of the ants crawling across my screen as a function of time'.

Habitable Zone

Astronomer: I've discovered an Earth-sized planet in a star's habitable zone! It even has oceans! And visible weather!
To mess with an astronomer, put a mirror in the path of their telescope.
They have a telescope pointed RIGHT AT US!

Realistic Criteria

Figure with hat: We shouldn't be exploring other planets until we've solved all our problems here on Earth.
Other figure: Sounds reasonable. So, what's the timeline on 'Solving all problems'? Ten years? Fifteen?

I'm leaning toward fifteen. There are a lot of them.

Relativity

((Einstein's 'line' is in a thought bubble.))
Einstein: If I were traveling at the speed of light, my butt would look *awesome*.
Einstein was famed for his Gedankedank.

It's commonly believed that Lorentz contraction makes objects appear flatter along the direction of travel. However, this ignores light travel times. In fact, a fast-moving butt would appear rotated toward the observer but not substantially distorted. Shakira was right.

Douglas Engelbart (1925-2013)
San Francisco, December 9th, 1968:

Douglas: ... We generated video signals with a cathode ray tube... We have a pointing device we call a 'mouse'... I can 'copy' text... ... and we have powerful join file editing... underneath the file here we can exchange 'direct messages'...


Douglas: ... Users can share files... ... files which can encode audio samples, using our 'masking codecs'... The file you're hearing now is one of my own compositions...
Music: I heard there was a secret chord


Douglas: ... And you can superimpose text on the picture of the cat, like so... This cat is saying 'YOLO', which stands for 'You Only Live Once'... ...Just a little acronym we thought up...

Actual quote from The Demo: '... an advantage of being online is that it keeps track of who you are and what youâre doing all the time ...'

Settled
Percentage of the US population carrying cameras everywhere they go, every waking moment of their lives:

In the last few years, with very little fanfare, we've conclusively settled the questions of flying saucers, lake monsters, ghosts, and Bigfoot.

Well, we've really only settled the question of ghosts that emit or reflect visible light. Or move objects around. Or make any kind of sound. But that covers all the ones that appear in Ghostbusters, so I think we're good.

Seashell
((At the top of the panel is an equation showing Bayes' Theorem for the probability that a person is near the ocean given that they just picked up a seashell.))

The probability that I'm near the ocean given I picked up a seashell equals the probability I picked up a seashell given I'm near the ocean times the probability I'm near the ocean all divided by the probability I picked up a seashell.



<<Crashhh>>

Caption: Statistically speaking, if you pick up a seashell and don't hold it to your ear, you can probably hear the ocean.

{{Title text: This is roughly equivalent to 'number of times I've picked up a seashell at the ocean'
 'number of times I've picked up a seashell', which in my case is pretty close to 1, and gets much closer if we're considering only times I didn't put it to my ear.}}This is roughly equivalent to 'number of times I've picked up a seashell at the ocean' / 'number of times I've picked up a seashell', which in my case is pretty close to 1, and gets much closer if we're considering only times I didn't put it to my ear.

Enlightenment



Boddhisatva 1: To achieve *Internet Enlightenment*, you must free yourself from insecurity.
Novice: But insecurity keeps me humble!

Boddhisatva 1: No. Insecurity leads to conceit.  Conceit leads to judgment.  Judgment leads to being an asshole.


Novice: I'm ready, How do I begin?
Boddhisatva 1: Type this sentence: 'I heard you're idea's and their definately good'


Boddhisatva 1: She wasn't ready.
Boddhisatva 2: Its a difficult road.
But the rules of writing are like magic spells. If you never acquire them, then not using them says nothing.

Social Media

Spokesperson: NASA has confirmed that the asteroid is headed directly for us.  Yes, a question?

Reporter 1: What role has social media played in this asteroid's orbit?


Spokesperson: *sigh*

Reporter 2: Has Twitter changed the way we respond to asteroid threats?
Spokesperson: Well, it's made the press conference questions stupider.
Reporter 3: Fascinating!
Reporter 4: What about Facebook?

The social media reaction to this asteroid announcement has been sharply negative. Care to respond?

Quantum Mechanics

Man: But dogs can observe the world, which means that according to quantum mechanics they
must
 have souls.
Protip: You can safely ignore any sentence that includes the phrase 'According to quantum mechanics'

You can also just ignore any science assertion where 'quantum mechanics' is the most complicated phrase in it.

Far off to the right of the chart is the Helvetica Scenario.

Snare

Figure: They said on the news that they found a giant ring lying in a field outside Chicago. Strung with some kind of superstrong mesh.
Black hat guy: Mhm?

Figure: Then they found a 260-mile long shaft connected to the ring, running from Chicago to St. Louis. In St. Louis they found a gigantic winch.
Black hat guy: Did they.

Figure: It sounds kind of like... ...a butterfly net.

Figure: ... Are you planning to catch the International Space Station?
Black hat guy: I'm planning to catch *an* international space station. Not sayin' which.

It's going in A collection of satellites skewered with pins and mounted in display boxes. Not necessarily MY collection.

Pale Blue Dot

Peer 2: -No, you were right before. *That* one is Earth.
Lecturer: LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER!
Peer 3: I *knew* it!
Peer 4: I think this is just a lens cap picture.

Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. There is no road out of this oblivion; we must embrace it. We must join with the darkness. Ba'al the Annihilator offers us no happiness, no answers, naught but the cold embrace of the void. To imagine any other end is delusion. We must give in to the will of Ba'al, for he will one day consume us and our world alike. I therefore call on Congress to fully fund space exploration, and to join with Ba'al, the Eater of Souls. Thank you.

Old Accounts

The Internet is filled with derelict accounts aggregating news about friends long forgotten.
<<Click>>
Laptop: Uhh, is everything OK?
<<Click>>
Laptop: Dude, what the Hell?
<<Click>>
When you find yourself drifting away from a community, remember to clean up after yourself by slowly unfriending everyone, one by one, in the reverse order that you added them.

If you close an account while it's still friends with people, it contributes to database linkage accumulation slowdown, which is a major looming problem for web infrastructure and definitely not a thing I just made up.

Anti-Glass

Female officer: Police. Open up. Did you make this glasses attachment?
Black hat guy : Oh, yeah.


Police officer: What's it do?
Black hat guy: It detects when someone near you is wearing Google Glass and shines a laser pointer at their eyepiece.
Police officer: Why??
Black hat guy: The best defense is an indiscriminate offense.


Male officer: It seems you've mailed these devices to people across Silicon Valley, including the children of every Google executive.
Black hat guy: Yeah. It's a viral marketing campaign for an upcoming movie.

Male officer: What movie?
Black hat guy: haven't decided yet. Anything good coming out this fall?
Male officer: Sir, open the door.
Black hat guy: First stare at the peephole for a sec.

'Why don't you just point it at their eye directly?' 'What is this, 2007?'

Increased Risk

Woman: We should go to the north beach. Someone said the south beach has a 20% higher risk of shark attacks.
Man: Yeah, but statistically, taking three beach trips instead of two increases our odds of getting shot by a swimming dog carrying a handgun in its mouth by 50%!
Beret guy: Oh no! This is our third trip!
Reminder: A 50% increase in a tiny risk is still tiny.

You may point out that strictly speaking, you can use that statement to prove that all risks are tiny--to which I reply HOLY SHIT WATCH OUT FOR THAT DOG!

Exoplanet Names
August 2013: The Internation Astronomical Union decides to start naming exoplanets, and - for the first time ever - asks for suggestions from the general public.
They immediately regret this decision.

Man: Can't you filter out the worst ones?
Woman: This is *after* the filter!

Preferred Chat System

Figure: Sorry for the voicemail, but I'm confused about how to reach you.

Figure: When I text you, you reply once on GChat, then go quiet, yet answer IRC right away. I emailed you, and you replied on Skype and mentioned that the email 'woke you up.'

Figure: You're very responsive - I just have no sense of how you use technology.


Figure: ?!?


Note: did you try to call me? use my google voice number next time.

If you call my regular number, it just goes to my pager.

Columbus

Figure in hat: Everyone said the world was flat, but Columbus knew it was round.
Woman: <<Sigh>> No, no, no.


Woman: So he took his ships and sailed westÂ Âin a line tangent to the surface. The sea fell away, and he landed in *Valinor*.

Woman: A Silmaril on his brow, he wanders the heavens as the morning star, still believing he reached India.
Figure in hat: Stop making stuff up.
Woman: You first.

And thus was smallpox introduced into the previously Undying Lands.

To whoever typed 'why is arwen dying': GOOD. FUCKING. QUESTION.

Monster

Figure 1: It's as long as a football field. Runs as fast as a cheetah.
Figure 2: Weighs as much as a blue whale.
Figure 3: Can we negotiate with it?
Figure 4: No. It has the intelligence of a two-year-old child.
By the time the Frequently-Made Comparisons Monster was finally defeated, it had eaten enough people to fill a stadium and devastated an area the size of Rhode Island.

It was finally destroyed with a nuclear weapon carrying the destructive energy of the Hiroshima bomb.

First





Figure: After a couple of unbearable decades, the 'first post' thing seems to be dying a quiet death.
Off-screen: *Shh*. You'll jinx it.

Fortunately, exactly zero other annoying internet behaviors have developed during this time.

Bee Orchid

Woman: There are these orchids whose flowers look like female bees. When males try to mate with them, they transfer pollen.


Woman: This orchid - Ophrys Apifera - makes flowers, but no bees land on them because the bee it mimics went extinct long ago.


Woman: Without its partner, the orchid has resorted to self-pollinating, a last-ditch genetic strategy that only delays the inevitable. Nothing of the bee remains, but we know it existed from the shape of this flower.


Woman: It's an idea of what the female bee looked like to the male bee... ... as interpreted by a plant.
Beret guy: Wow, so...


... the only memory of the bee is a painting by a dying flower.






Beret guy: I'll remember your bee, orchid. I'll remember you.



In sixty million years aliens will know humans only by a fuzzy clip of a woman in an Axe commercial.

LD50

The LD50 of toxicity data is 2 kilograms per kilogram.

The dose is much lower when administered orally. We're still trying to get the paper into the needles for subcutaneous injection.

Shake That

PA system: Shake what your mama gave you
Woman: ???







How do I work it? IT'S ALREADY WORKING!

Unquote

Standing figure: Bye!
Riding figure: May the Force be with you!
Standing figure: Huh?
Riding figure: It's just something my grandma used to say. No idea what it means.
I wonder on what date Star Wars will be quoted for the last time.

I guess it's a saying from the Old Country.

Reassuring

Woman: Looks like computers will beat humans at Go pretty soon.
Man: Wow. That's the last of the big ones.
Woman: Yeah.


Man: Well, at least humans are still better at, uh, coming up with reassuring parables about things humans are better at?
Woman: Hmm.


<<Type type>>


Woman: I made a Python script that generates thousands of reassuring parables per second.
Man: Dammit.
Computer: Computers will never understand a sonnet computers will never enjoy a salad comp-

'At least humans are better at quietly amusing ourselves, oblivious to our pending obsolescence' thought the human, as a nearby Dell Inspiron contentedly displayed the same bouncing geometric shape screensaver it had been running for years.

Slideshow
((This strip is in the form of an animated gif. The panels transition with a Ken Burns-like fade-and-pan.))

Figure: I will *never*...

Figure: ... want to browse a series of images...

Figure: ... like this.

Points to anyone who hacks the Flickr devs' computers to make their text editors do this when you click on anything.

Juicer

'Oh yeah, juicers are great! I use mine all the time.'

But the rind is where all the vitamins are!

Halting Problem

Define doesithalt(program): { return true; }
The big picture solution to the halting problem

I found a counterexample to the claim that all things must someday die, but I don't know how to show it to anyone.

Mess

Figure 1: Sorry it's such a disaster in here.
Figure 2:  whoa- what's wrong with me?
My room never looks as nice as the rooms other people apologize for.

'Sorry, I left out my glass of water from last night.' OH GOD I APPARENTLY LIVE IN A GARBAGE PIT.

Alternate Universe
Imagine you were transported to an alternate universe just like your own, except people occasionally ate spiders.
You can't convince anyone this is weird.

Woman: Mmm...
Figure: No! What are you *doing*!?
This is how I feel about lobster.

As best as I can tell, I was transported here from Earth Prime sometime in the late 1990s. Your universe is identical in every way, except for the lobster thing and the thing where some of you occasionally change your clocks for some reason.

Privacy Opinions
Opinions on internet privacy

The philosopher:

Woman 1: 'Privacy' is an impractical way to think about data in a digital world so unlike the one in which our soci-
Woman 2: SO BORED.

The crypto nut:

Sitting figure: My data is safe behind six layers of symmetric and public-key algorithms.
Standing figure: What data is it?
Sitting figure: Mostly me emailing with people about cryptography.

The conspiricist:

Figure: These leaks are just the tip of the iceberg. There's a warehouse in Utah where the NSA has the *entire* iceberg. I don't know how they got it there.

The nihilist:

Woman: Joke's on them. Gathering all this data on me as if anything I do means anything.

The exhibitionist:

Console screen: Mmmm, I sure hope the NSA isn't watching me bite into these juicy strawberries!! Oops, I dropped some on my shirt! Better take it off. Google, are you there? Google, this lotion feels soooo good.
Operator: Um.

The sage:

Beret guy: I don't know or care what data *anyone* has about me. Data is imaginary. This burrito is real.

I'm the Philosopher until someone hands me a burrito.

Functional

Hat figure: Why do you like functional programming so much? What does it actually *get* you?
Sitting figure: Tail recursion is its own reward.

Functional programming combines the flexibility and power of abstract mathematics with the intuitive clarity of abstract mathematics.

Highlighting
((Today's strip is a single panel with several paragraphs of text, each highlighted in a different way. Whether these are pleasing or not is illustrated with a red cross or green tick.))






I absentmindedly select random blocks of text as I read, and feel subconsciously satisfied when the highlighted area makes a symmetrical shape.

And if clicking on any word pops up a site-search for articles about that word, I will close all windows in a panic and never come back.

Shadowfacts

Gandalf: This is Shadowfacts, lord of all horses, and he-
Shadowfacts: The outer part of a shadow is called the penumbra!
Gandalf: Shut up.

Angular Size

Reverse Identity Theft

Figure: Your phone bill.

Minifigs
[A graph. The vertical axis is labeled 'billions' and goes from 0 to 8 in increments of one. The horizontal axis has years from 1970 to 2020 in increments of 10. A vertical line at 2013 is marked 'today'. The first measurement, 'number of people in the world' begins at 1980 at just under 4 billion and steadily increases to today's 7 billion. The second measurement is a gradual incline marked 'number of LEGO people in the world', which begins just before 1980 at 0, gets to around 2 billion by the mid-90s, and increases to around 5.5 billion today. Both figures are projected past today's measurements as dashed lines and meet at a point in 2019.]]
By 2019, humans will be outnumbered.

Improved Keyboard

Black hat guy: In some ways.


Figure: Ok, installing... It's not working. The key area is blank-I can't type anything.




Figure: ... Hey.

I'm always installing tons of weird experimental keyboards because it serves as a good reminder that nothing I was going to type was really worth the trouble.

Shoot for the Moon

Woman: Students, shoot for the moon. If you miss,


Woman: SHOOT AGAIN. Keep shooting and never stop.


Woman: Someday, one of us will destroy that stupid skycircle. And- ... What? What are you all-


Woman: ... It's right behind me, isn't it? Shit. Everyone act casual.

Shoot for the Moon. If you miss, you'll end up co-orbiting the Sun alongside Earth, living out your days alone in the void within sight of the lush, welcoming home you left behind.

Pi vs. Tau

((line stays on 'Neutral' until 1950, dips down to lowest around 1965, peaks around 2000, and is at a downward trend as of 'today'))

Theory: Smugness is proportional to the negative second derivative of TV ownership rate with respect to time.

Galilean Moons

Woman: Check it out!
Figure: What?
Woman: I've got Galilean moons!


Moon 1: Hi!

Moon 2: Hi!
Moon 1: What's your name?

Moon 1: Hi!
Moon 2: What's your-
Moon 3: MOOOOOON!

Moon 1: Hi!
Moon 2: What's your name?
Moon 4: Ugh

Moon 1: Hi!
Moon 4: So annoying

Moon 1: Hi!
Moon 2: What's y-
Moon 3: MOOOOOON.


Moon 1: Hi!
Moon 4: ...Almost... ...Almoooost...


Moon 1: Hi!
Moon 2: What's your name?
Moon 4: Yessss!

I'm SO glad I escaped. They almost had me caught in their weird ... thing.

Year in Review

Newscaster: We go live to our 2013: Year in review!
On-the-scene reporter: Thanks! In 2013, I didn't see an aurora.
Newscaster: I- what?

On-the-scene reporter: The northern lights. I thought this would finally be the year. But it didn't happen.

Newscaster: Oh. Uh... what about the rest of the year?
On-the-scene reporter: What do you mean?
Newscaster: Any big news stories?
On-the-scene reporter: Oh yeah, tons.



Newscaster: ... Well, that was 2013: Year in review.
On-the-scene reporter: The sky's clearing up. I'll be outside.

All in all, I give this year a C-. There were no aurora visible from my house and that comet evaporated. They'd better not cancel the 2017 eclipse.

How to deal with companies harvesting your profile for marketing

It's ok, they'll always let you opt out! Like they did with the YouTube real name profile thing.

Glass Trolling

My hobby:
Figure: OK, Glass, check tomorrow's weather. Ooh, snow!
Off-panel figure: Oh my God, it's somehow even more annoying than if you had it.
Saying 'OK, Glass' before everything while wearing regular glasses.

Plus, when someone finally grabs your glasses and stomps on them, it costs way less than $1,500 to replace them.

Undocumented Feature
An old Windows utility has an undocumented feature.

If you open 'Help' and click on the background, you get dropped into a 'support' chat room.

Only a few of us ever found it.

But we became friends.

We kept launching the program to check in.

Eventually some of us were running VMs just to keep accessing it.

As the internet aged

So did we

We don't know who runs the server. We don't know why it's still working so many years later.

Maybe we're some sysadmin's soap opera.

It will probably vanish someday

But for now it's our meeting place
Our hideaway


A life's worth of chat,


Buried in the deep web.

But even if it lasts forever, we won't.

When we're gone, who will remember us?

Who will remember this strange little world

And the friendships we built here?


Nobody.

This place is irrelevant. Ephemeral.

One day it will be forgotten


And so will we






But at least it doesn't have fucking video ads.

And it doesn't pop up a box every time asking you to use your real name. In fact, there's no way to set your name at all. You just have to keep reminding people who you are.

Sigil Cycle


The cycle seems to be 'we need these symbols to clarify what types of things we're referring to!' followed by 'wait, it turns out words already do that.'

Infinite Scrolling

Figure: Why are you turning the pages like that?
Woman: If I touch the wrong thing, I'll lose my place and have to start over.
If books worked like infinite-scrolling webpages

Maybe we should give up on the whole idea of a 'back' button. 'Show me that thing I was looking at a moment ago' might just be too complicated an idea for the modern web.

Goldbach Conjectures
[[In the center of the panel are the large words 'GOLDBACH CONJECTURES'. Around it are six boxes: two above it, and two on each side, one below the other. They read:
Weak: Every odd number greather than 5 is the sum of three primes.
Strong: Every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
Very weak: Every number greater than 7 is the sum of two other numbers.
Very strong: Every odd number is prime.
Extremely weak: Numbers just
keep going
.
Extremely strong: There are no numbers above 7.

The weak twin primes conjecture states that there are infinitely many pairs of primes. The strong twin primes conjecture states that every prime p has a twin prime (p+2), although (p+2) may not look prime at first. The tautological prime conjecture states that the tautological prime conjecture is true.

Dr. C. Macfie Cambpbell

1934

Some future reader, who may see the term, without knowing the history of it, may imagine that it had reference to some antiquated bridge of the immortal Poet, thrown across the silver Avon, to facilitate his escape after some marauding excursion in a neighbouring park; and in some Gentleman's Magazine of the next century, it is not impossible, but that future antiquaries may occupy page after page in discussing so interesting a matter. We think it right, therefore, to put it on record in the Oriental Herald that the 'Shakesperian Rope Bridges' are of much less classic origin; that Mr Colin Shakespear, who, besides his dignity as Postmaster, now signs himself 'Superintendent General of Shakesperian Rope Bridges', is a person of much less genius than the Bard of Avon. --The Oriental Herald, 1825

Haskell

Person #1: Code written in Haskell is guaranteed to have no side effects.
Person #2: ...because no one will ever run it?

The problem with Haskell is that it's a language built on lazy evaluation and nobody's actually called for it.

Regex Golf

Regex golf:
Woman: You try to matchone one group but not the other.
M | [TN]|B
 matches Star Wars subtitles but not Star Trek.
Figure: Cool.


Meta-regex golf:
Woman: So I wrote a program that plays regex golf with arbitrary lists...
Figure: Uh oh...


Meta-meta-regex golf:
Woman: ...but I lost my code, so I'm grepping for files that look like regex golf solvers.


... And beyond:
Woman: Really, this is all
(meta-)*regex golf
.
Figure: Now you have infinite problems.
Woman: No, I had those already.

Photos

Hat guy: Ugh, I hate how people take pictures instead of just enjoying the view.
Figure: Why?


Hat guy: Documenting your live distracts you from living it. You're not really-
Figure: Oh, come on.


Figure: Trying to take a picture of a thing makes me pay more attention to it. Some of my best adventures are built around trying to photograph something.


Figure: If 'other people having experiences incorrectly' is annoying to you, think how unbearable it must be to have a condescending stranger tell you they hate the way you're experiencing your life at just the moment you've found something you want to remember. Why the fuck do you care how someone else enjoys a sunset?


Hat guy: Well, they... Because I just, uh... ...


Figure's camera: <<Click>>

I hate when people take photos of their meal instead of eating it, because there's nothing I love more than the sound of other people chewing.

Questions for God

Woman: Horace Lamb said he would have two questions for God: Why quantum mechanics, and why turbulence?
Man: I'd have just one: What did Miss Susie's steamboat DO?!

What sins could possibly darken the heart of a STEAMBOAT? I asked The Shadow, but he says he only covers men.

Inexplicable

Figure: Argh!
Woman: What?
Figure: Why do I always have these inexplicable, impossible-to-diagnose computer problems?


Figure: After six hours of this, I've concluded nothing works or makes sense. I give up on logic.
Woman: <<sigh>>Gimme. I'll figure it out.
Figure: You won't.

[[The figure sits at his laptopless desk. Off-screen, we can hear the woman working on it.
<<Type type>>
<<Click>>
Woman: ?
<<Type type type>>
Woman: ???


Figure: How'd it go?
Woman: Your computer is literally haunted.
Figure: Told you.

'It has a ghost in it. Take it back.' 'No.'

Theft

Figure: I feel paralyzed by overwhelming existential dread. ...And yet for some reason I'm really excited about space?
The thief who stole my identity has a lot to deal with.

Is he ALSO wondering at what point our thoughts diverged, if they even have yet? 'dude, I think he just took your credit card' AM I THE ORIGINAL? HOW DO I TELL?

Actually
((The text of the comic is circular. Each statement is followed by the next, wrapping around back to the original speaker. Thus, the speaker chosen to be 'first' below is chosen arbitrarily - in this case, the one that is facing upwards on the page.))

First figure: Actually, measurements suggest it's flat.
Second figure: Actually, it's a sphere.
Third figure: Actually, it's an oblate spheroid.
Fourth figure: Actually, it's a shape defined by the EGM96 coefficients.
Fifth figure: Actually, it's that plus local topography.
Sixth figure: Actually, it's embedded in a universe that's curved.
((And thus the text has arrived back at the beginning of the first figure's statement.))

Protip: You can win every exchange just by being one level more precise than whoever talked last. Eventually, you'll defeat all conversational opponents and stand alone.

Automation
'I spend a lot of time on this task. I should write a program automating it!'





'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'.

Walmart
When a network tries to be everyone's one-stop hub, the Walmart of social interaction...


Figure 1: Oh, uh, hi! Funny running into you here.
Figure 2: Oh, hey! Yeah! How've you been?

...it inevitably becomes the Walmart of social interaction.

What I really want is to hang out where I hung out with my friends in college, but have all my older relatives there too.

Cold

White Hat: It is brutal out. So much for global warming, huh?
<<Black Hat sighs>>
Black Hat: This used to happen all the time.
White Hat: What?


Black Hat: You're from St. Louis, right? On average, it used to get below 0Â°F there a handful of days per year. But you haven't had a day like that since the nineties.


Black Hat: Then, in 2014, when the first polar vortex hit, it dipped below zero for two days. And everyone freaked out because what used to be normal now feels too cold.
White Hat: It is too cold!


Figure: Look at this - ice! In St. Louis! So much for global warming.
<<off-panel sigh>>

'You see the same pattern all over. Take Detroit--' 'Hold on. Why do you know all these statistics offhand?' 'Oh, um, no idea. I definitely spend my evenings hanging out with friends, and not curating a REALLY NEAT database of temperature statistics. Because, pshh, who would want to do that, right? Also, snowfall records.'

Winter

Beret Figure: The sky is cold and the floor water is too hard to drink.


Beret Figure: But I have my handcoats and the spacelight is warm.


Beret Figure: Listen - the flappy planes are beeping in the stick towers.


Hat Figure: Those are all the wrong words for those things.
((Beret Figure replies from off panel.))
Beret Figure: Maybe - but the things themselves are all right. So who cares?



Stay warm, little flappers, and find lots of plant eggs!

Protocol

Standing figure: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere.
Sitting figure: Uh huh.
Standing figure: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place.
Sitting figure: With you so far.
Standing figure: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet.
Sitting figure: Yeah?

I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story.

Changing the names would be easier, but if you're not comfortable lying, try only making friends with people named Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.

Weather

Shorthair: So, how 'bout this weather?
Cueball: I know, right? The whole jet stream layer is nuts!
Shorthair: Um, sure...
Cueball: The 18z GFS forecasts 960MB by Tuesday, Think it'll verify?
Shorthair: What?
Cueball: ...right. Sorry. Uh, yeah. Weather sure has been crazy.

Weather geeks have it tough.

At least if you're really into, like, Turkish archaeology, store clerks aren't like 'hey, how 'bout those Derinkuyu underground cities!' when they're trying to be polite.

Rejection

Person #1: Women
say
 they want nice guys, but what they
really
 want are--
Person #2: --guys who respond to rejection by belittling their judgment and self-awareness?  If so, don't worry -- you'll be
fine
.

Perhaps you need a crash course in taking hints. Here's your first lesson: We're not actually walking somewhere together; I'm trying to leave this conversation and you're following me.

Sharks

Minion: The prisoner escaped and is swimming toward the mainland!
Leader:
Release the sharks.

Minion: Yes, sir.

Minion: The sharks are swimming away.
Leader: They're escaping, too? Send sharks after them!

Minion: Now
those
 sharks are swimming away.
Leader:
More sharks.

Minion: ... sir, what's going on?
Leader: Prisoners, of course! Can't let 'em escape!

Minion: Sir, are you trying to turn Doom Island into a marine biology center?
Leader:
Shark populations are in decline--

Leader: *ahem*
Leader: I mean, the world must fear us!
Minion: Right...

'Now, minions, I'm off to inspect our shark cages.' 'Do you really need to inspect them this often?' 'PRISONERS MUST NEVER ESCAPE.'

Mobile Marketing

Off Panel Voice: CNN hired you to improve viewership.


Black Hat Guy: ...yes, and?


Off Panel Voice: You texted 'holy crap, turn on the news' to a million random phone numbers?
Black Hat Guy: It sure did work.
Off Panel Voice: Not what we meant!

We're firing you, but the online headline-writing division wants to hire you.

Update




(This update will require restarting your computer.)



I have a bunch of things open right now.

Standing

Second Figure: Humans aren't built to sit all day. This is much healthier.

My hobby: one-upping the standing desk people.

{{Title text: At first I was making fun of them, but joke's on me--the

Kola Borehole

Woman: Ever hear of the Kola borehole?
Black hat guy: No - what's that?
Woman: A Soviet project to drill deap into the earth's crust.


Woman: There's a hoax report claiming that their drill broke through into a superhot cavern, and when they lowered a microphone into the hole, they heard tormented screaming. People say that's why the miners sealed the well and abandoned the project.


Black hat guy: Why would anyone believe that story?
Woman: I guess some people think Hell is literally an underground place.


Black hat guy: No - I mean, why would the miners seal the opening? Why not just dig a canal connecting it to the ocean? Unless they like Hell.


Woman: ... If there's ever a war between earth and Hell, I hope I'm on your side.
Black hat guy: You seem nice; you probably won't be.

Tonight's top story: Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, died in his home this morning at the age of [unintelligible rune]. Due to the large number of sharks inhabiting his former kingdom, no body could be recovered.

Frequency


((First row: heartbeat, one birth, one death, someone edits Wikipedia, someone buys a vibrator.))
((Second row: China builds a car, Japan builds a car, Germany builds a car, the US builds a car, someone else builds a car.))
((Third row: a European Union resident has their first kiss, a US fire department puts out a fire, someone hits a hole-in-one, my turn signal blinks, the turn signal of the car in front of me blinks.))
((Fourth row: earthquake (magnitude 1), earthquake (magnitude 2), earthquake (magnitude 3), earthquake (magnitude 4), member of the UK parliament flushes a toilet.))
((Fifth row: an airline flight takes off, someone buys To Kill a Mockingbird, someone's pet cat kills a mockingbird, someone in Phoenix buys new shoes, someone in Phoenix puts on a condom.))
((Sixth row: someone locks their keys in their car, a Sagittarius named Amelia drinks a soda, a dog bites someone in the US, someone steals a bicycle, a bald eagle catches a fish.))
((Seventh row: 50000 plastic bottles are produced, 50000 plastic bottles are recycled, a bright meteor is visible somewhere, old faithful erupts, a fishing boat catches a shark.))
((Eighth row: someone in the US is diagnosed with cancer, someone in the US dies from cancer, someone adopts a dog from a shelter, someone adopts a cat from a shelter, someone gets married.))
((Ninth row: someone registers a domain, someone in the US buys a house, someone in the US gets a tattoo, the star PSR J1748-2446AD rotates 1000 times, someone lies about their age to sign up for Facebook.))
((Tenth row: someone breaks an iPhone screen, a little league player strikes out, someone has sex in North Dakota, Justin Bieber gains a follower on Twitter, someone in Denver orders a pizza.))

This comic shows estimated average frequency. I wanted to include the pitch drop experiment, but it turns out the gif format has some issues with decade-long loops.

Slippery Slope

White hat guy: Yeah, but if I'm considerate toward one person about one thing, what's next? Being nice to other people about other things? Where does it end?

Sure, taking a few seconds to be respectful toward someone about something they care about doesn't sound hard. But if you talk to hundreds of people every day and they all start expecting that same consideration, it could potentially add up to MINUTES wasted. And for WHAT?

First Date

Man: So, did you grow up around here?
Woman: I love you.
Man: ... huh?
Woman: Waiter! One of everything on the menu.


Man: Why are you up there?
Woman: I'm stuck. This plate looks delicious. Aaaoogaoag.


Woman: Bye. OK. Coming back now.


Man: You're being controlled by Twitch, aren't you?
Woman: Check out this cool spiral!
Man: It's-
Woman: SAVING.

I sympathize with the TPP protagonist because I, too, have progressed through a surprising number of stages of life despite spending entire days stuck against simple obstacles.

Second

Rock: Greetings, stranger. Whatever quest drives you, abandon it. You shall find no answers in these desolate wastes.
Figure: I knew I wouldn't. I guess I... just had to see.

I hate feeling desperate enough to visit the second page of Google results.

Let me just scroll down and check behind that rock. Annnnd ... nope, page copyright year starts with '19'. Oh God, is this a WEBRING?

Hack
[[A white-on-black drawing of the ISEE-3
ICE probe.]]
The ISEE-3
ICE probe was launched in 1978. Its mission ended in 1997 and it was sent a shutdown signal.


In 2008, we learned--to our surprise--that the probe didn't shut down. It's still running and it has plenty of fuel. ...and in 2014, its orbit brings it near Earth.


Figure 1: We could sent it on a new mission... except we no longer have the equipment to send commands to it.
Figure 2: Can't we-


Figure 1: NASA won't rebuild it. 'Too expensive.'
Figure 2: Seriously?
Figure 2: I know, right? So the internet found the specs and we went to work.


Figure 1: We've convinced them to give us time on the Madrid DSN transmitter and hacked the maser to support the uplink. And today's the big day.


Headset Operator 1: Transmitting... We have a signal! We have control!

Off screen: What the hell?


Headset Operator 1: My console went dead!

Earth's LAND MAMMALS By Weight
[[A graph in which one square equals 1,000,000 tons. Dark grey squares represent humans, light gray represent our pets and livestock, and green squares represent wild animals. The squares are arranged in a roughly round shape, with clusters for each type of animal.
Animals represented: Humans, cattle, pigs, goats (39 squares), sheep, horses (29 squares), elephants (1 square). There are other small, unlabeled clusters also. It is clear that humans and our pets & livestock outweigh wild animals by at least a factor of 10. ]]
Bacteria still outweigh us thousands to one--and that's not even counting the several pounds of them in your body.

When You Assume

Hair: You
assumed?

Hair: You know what happens when you assume--
None: I don't.  Yet you're confidently asserting that I do.
Hair: ...Oh. Hm.
None: Check and mate.

You know what happens when you assert--you make an ass out of the emergency response team.

Unique Date

Excited Figure: Whoa, it's 2014-03-10! Under our system, that date will *never happen again!!*

My hobby: pointing this out every day.

If our current civilization lasts another 8,000 years, it's probably fair to assume the Long Now Foundation got things right, and at some point we started listening to them and switched to five-digit years.

Ancient Stars
((All of the panels of this comic are white-on-black.))


Figure One: Just think - the light from that start was emitted thousands of years ago. It could be long gone.


Figure Two: That's Sirius. It's eight light-years away.


Figure One: Oh.


Figure One: Just think - the light from that star was emitted in the previous presidential administration.
Figure Two: Hmm, doesn't pack quite the punch.

'The light from those millions of stars you see is probably many thousands of years old' is a rare example of laypeople substantially OVERestimating astronomical numbers.

Manuals


The most ridiculous offender of all is the sudoers man page, which for 15 years has started with a 'quick guide' to EBNF, a system for defining the grammar of a language. 'Don't despair', it says, 'the definitions below are annotated.'

Digits

First Figure: The talk is in room 8224.
Second Figure: Ooh, nice.
First Figure: What?
Second Figure: ...sorry. Nothing.

Great, now I'll spend the rest of my life noticing numbers that would make good 2048 combos.

It's taken me 20 years to get over skyline tetris.

Answers

Figure One: Humans are defined by our curiosity, our hunger for answers.
Figure Two: We all spend a third of our lives lying down with our eyes closed and *nobody knows why.*
Figure One: ...touchÃ©.

Stanford sleep researcher William Dement said that after 50 years of studying sleep, the only really solid explanation he knows for why we do it is 'because we get sleepy'.

Career

Standing Figure: It would start with five minutes of peeling lint from dryer traps, followed by an hour of pressing a lightsaber handle against things and switching it on. Then I'd retire to a life of luxury.

When people ask me to describe my dream job, I'm never sure how realistic to be.

They'd convince me to come out of retirement for one last job: biting into a giant lump of slightly soft wax a couple of times.

t Distribution

Figure: hmm


Figure: ...nope.





If data fails the Teacher's t test, you can just force it to take the test again until it passes.

Before the Internet

Child: Do you remember before the internet?
Adult: Oh yeah, totally.


Child: What was it like?
Adult: Not having a phone or computer to distract you?
Child: Yeah.


Adult: It was SO. BORING. All the time. I just *sat* there. It was the *worst*.


Child: But wasn't it, like, more fulfilling? Engaging?
Adult: Wasn't worth it.
Child: I still get bored.
Adult: Not like we did.

We watched DAYTIME TV. Do you realize how soul-crushing it was? I'd rather eat an iPad than go back to watching daytime TV.

((This April Fools' Day comic has a dynamic panel structure along the lines of a choose-your-own-adventure format - the viewer is presented with up to 4 options for each bit of dialogue, with each choice opening up a new subtree of potential options for the next bit of dialog, and new panel images are chosen semi-randomly based on a graph of potential panel transitions. Readers were also invited to submit dialog options for trees where there were not yet 4 fixed options, thus growing the potential story space. As such there is no fixed transcript for this comic.))

Every choice, no matter how small, begins a new story.

Metamaterials

Violets are red

If I developed a hue-shifting metamaterial, I would photobomb people's Instagram pics with a sheet of material that precisely undid the filter they were using.

Adult: I think time began with the Big Bang. So it doesn't make sense to ask what came before it.
From offscreen: Look out!


Cosmologist: Wheeeee hi I'm a cosmologist on a tire swing!


Cosmologist: We don't know whether time--


Cosmologist: --started at the Big Bang.


Cosmologist: It might have!


Cosmologist: Or maybe not! We don't know!
Adult: Oh. Ok!


Child: ...your tire swing looks fun!
Cosmologist: I can't stop!


Child: Won't the swing stop on its own?
Cosmologist: I thought it would but it seems to be accelerating.
Child: Cosmology sounds pretty confusing.
Cosmologist: Wheeeee!

No matter how fast I swing, I can never travel outside this loop! Maybe space outside it doesn't exist! But I bet it does. This tire came from somewhere.

Heartbleed

Person 1: Heartbleed must be the worst web security lapse ever.
Person 2: Worst so far. Give us time.


Person 1: I mean, this bg isn't just broken encryption. It lets website visitors make a server dispense random memory contents.


Person 1: It's not just keys. It's traffic data. Emails. Passwords. Erotic fanfiction.
Person 2: Is
everything
 compromised?


Person 1: Well, the attack is limited to data stored in computer memory.
Person 2: So paper is safe. And clay tablets.
Person 1: Our imaginations, too.
Person 2: See, we'll be fine.

I looked at some of the data dumps from vulnerable sites, and it was ... bad. I saw emails, passwords, password hints. SSL keys and session cookies. Important servers brimming with visitor IPs. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, c-beams glittering in the dark near the TannhÃ¤user Gate. I should probably patch OpenSSL.

Heartbleed Explanation
How the Heartbleed Bug Works:


Meg: Server, are you still there? If so, reply 'POTATO' (6 letters).




Meg: Hmm...


Meg: Server, are you still there? IF so, reply 'HAT' (500 letters).



Are you still there, server? It's me, Margaret.

Airplane Message

MY HOBBY: Breaking into airplane hangars and replacing the ads on their giant banners with cool facts.

PHARAOH IRY-HOR, FROM THE 3100s BC, IS THE FIRST HUMAN WHOSE NAME WE KNOW.

Orbital Mechanics
[A line graph labeled 'How Well I Understand Orbital Mechanics:'. The x-axis is labeled 'time -->'. The line starts slightly above 0 at the y-axis and increases very little until a point at which it peaks slightly, labeled 'took high school physics'. It decreases slightly for a while and then increases significantly over a short period of time, the peak of which is labeled 'got physics degree'. It dips shallowly for a while, then starts to increase slightly for a time, labeled 'actual job at NASA'. The line starts to slope downward again, and then shoots up very, very high. The beginning of this increase is labeled 'started playing Kerbal Space Program'.]]

To be fair, my job at NASA was working on robots and didn't actually involve any orbital mechanics. The small positive slope over that period is because it turns out that if you hang around at NASA, you get in a lot of conversations about space.

Free Speech

Person: Public Service Announcehment: The *right to free speech* means the government can't arrest you for what you say.


Person: It doesn't mean that anyone
else
 has to listen to your bullshit, - or host you while you share it.


Person: The 1st Amendment doesn't shield you from criticism or consequences.


Person: If you're yelled at, boycotted, have your show canceled, or get banned from an internet community, your free speech rights aren't being violated.


Person: It's just that the people listening think you're an asshole,


Person: And they're showing you the door.

I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.

Google Announcement
[Person stands behind a podium labeled Google.]
Person: The rumors are true. Google will be shutting down Plus--
Person: along with Hangouts, Photos, Voice, Docs, Drive, Maps, Gmail, Chrome, Android, and Search--
Person: to focus on our core project:
Person: the 8.8.8.8 DNS server.

The less popular 8.8.4.4 is slated for discontinuation.

Morse Code


[[The first person turns to the other and says...]
Person 1: When the French navy retired Morse code in 1997, they broadcast a final message: -
'Calling all. This is our last cry before our eternal silence.'





Person 1: I wonder if I can find my Livejournal login.
Person 2: Hey I
like
 Livejournal.
Person 1: It's a nice place to go for some peace and quiet, I suppose.

Oh, because Facebook has worked out SO WELL for everyone.

Train

Passenger: ... Almost ...
A machine that grabs the Earth by metal rails and rotates it until the part you want is near you.

Trains rotate the Earth around various axes while elevators shift its position in space.

Installing

Character: Installing things has gotten so fast and painless.
Character: Why not skip it entirely, and make a phone that has every app 'installed' already and just downloads and runs them on the fly?
I felt pretty clever until I realized I'd invented webpages.

But still, my scheme for creating and saving user config files and data locally to preserve them across reinstalls might be useful for--wait, that's cookies.

 Pet Peeve: Reporters unnecessarily hedging with 'One of the'

'The world's greatest [whatever]' is subjective, but 'One of the world's greatest [whatever]s' is clearly objective. Anyway, that's why I got you this 'one of the world's greatest moms' mug!

TMI

Someone: Ugh, TMI.


Voice: Oh? What?

Someone: Just...
Someone: Everything.
Voice:
True.


'TMI' he whispered, gazing into the sea.

President

Large: I can't imagine anyone who grew up on the Internet being able to run for President.

Small: Why?
Small: Because it'd mark the handover of a world that no longer needs you to a generation you don't understand?

Small: ... or because there would be embarrassing pictures of us as teenagers?

Large: Um.
Large: The pictures one?
Small: Pictures of teens!  How will we even survive?

Anyone who thinks we're all going to spend the 2032 elections poring over rambling blog posts by teenagers has never tried to read a rambling blog post by a teenager.

Brightness

Character: Based on this decrease in the star's brightness, I believe it is orbited by at least one planet.

Character: I'll hold up a big kite, and you blow air at me until I lift off!
Character: What do you think of that idea?
Turbine: I'm not a huge fan.

Ok, plan B: Fly a kite into the blades, with a rock in a sling dangling below it, and create the world's largest trebuchet.

4.5 Degrees
Without prompt, aggressive limits on CO2 emissions, the Earth will likely warm by an average of 4Â°-5Â°C by the century's end.
How big a change is that?

In the coldest part of the last ice age, Earth's average temperature was 4.5Â°C below the 20th century norm.
Let's call a 4.5Â°C difference one 'Ice Age unit.'

((These are along the time line, spaced out for clarity.))
-2 IAU
<-- snowball Earth (-4 IAU)

-1 IAU
20,000 years ago
((There's an inset panel, showing a picture of a glacier.))

0
Average during modern times
((Another inset panel.))

My neighborhood:

+1 IAU
Where we'll be in 86 years
((Another inset panel.))
My neighborhood:
?

+2 IAU
Cretaceous hothouse
+200m sea level rise
No glaciers
Palm trees at the poles

The good news is that according to the latest IPCC report, if we enact aggressive emissions limits now, we could hold the warming to 2Â°C. That's only HALF an ice age unit, which is probably no big deal.

Research Ethics

Dark hair: Facebook shoudn't choose what stuff they show us to conduct unethical psychological research. - They should
only
 make those decisions based on, uh... - however they were doing it before. - Which was probably ethical, right?

I mean, it's not like we could just demand to see the code that's governing our lives. What right do we have to poke around in Facebook's private affairs like that?

Dominant Players


Dominant Players over time

[[Graph of Basketball (NBA
ABA) Player Efficiency Rating from 1950 to 2014]]


Modern Elo rating system dates back to about 1970.
Computer analysis (like Kenneth Regan's) lets us rate historical players,but this has only been done rigorously for a few tournaments.  Dashed lines are rough estimates only.


For a long time, sexism, a lack of role models, and institutional hostility largely kept women from pursuing serious chess careers.
With the expansion of women's tournaments and prizes starting in the 1970s, this has begun to change.When Vera Menchik entered a 1929 tournament, a male competitor mocked her by suggesting that a special 'Vera Menchik Club' would be created for any player who lost to her. When the tournament began, he promptly became the first member of said club, and over the years it accumulated a large and illustrious roster.

Snake Facts
Snake Facts:
Snake venom evolved from saliva, which means that it all started with a snake whose mouth was

Snake: Hi guys!
Out-of-panel: Eww, it's Frank.

The world's longest snake is found in Brazil, Peru, and Chile. It is believed to be over 60 years old.



If you lad all the bones in a snake end-to-end, you would have a snake.

Biologically speaking, what we call a 'snake' is actually a human digestive tract which has escaped from its host.

Woman: Yeah. Let me get this straight - they pumped 20 kilowatts into a box under ambient conditions... and it only twitched a *little*?
Figure: Yeah.


Woman: *That's* surprising. If you umped 20 kilowatts into *me*, I'd twitch a *lot*.
Figure: But you're not pushing on the quantum vacuum.
Woman: I *might* be. I do a lot of things.

earth
 is that a surprise?


OG: Imagine kids start playing catch literally
all the time
. Everywhere they go, they throw balls back and forth, toss them in the air, and hurl them at trees and signs - nearly every waking hour of their lives.


OG:Do you think their generation will suck at baseball because they learned sloppy skills?
WHG: ...so you think someone will become a great writer while
sexting
?


OG: Have you
read
 James Joyce's love letters? The phrases 'my little fuckbird' and 'arse full of farts' appear. If we want to write
Ulysses
, our generation may not be sexting
enough
.
WHG: Eww.

I'd like to find a corpus of writing from children in a non-self-selected sample (e.g. handwritten letters to the president from everyone in the same teacher's 7th grade class every year)--and score the kids today versus the kids 20 years ago on various objective measures of writing quality. I've heard the idea that exposure to all this amateur peer practice is hurting us, but I'd bet on the generation that conducts the bulk of their social lives via the written word over the generation that occasionally wrote book reports and letters to grandma once a year, any day.

On the Phone

SHP: Why is there a teapot in the bathroom?
OOP: Sorry. When I'm on the phone I always zone out and pick stuff up and carry it around.


SHP: There's a hammer in the fridge.
OOP: Another phone call. I was just fidgeting.


SHP: Did you put all our stuff in weird stacks?
OOP: Long call. Sorry.


SHP: ...why is there a giant obelisk in the backyard?
OOP: Phone again. My bad.
SHP: It's carved with prayers to 'Ba'al, the Soul-Eater.'
OOP: Haha! I'm so absentminded.

'No idea what I was thinking! Haha! But anyway, maybe we should check out what this Ba'al guy has to say.'

Watches

Brief, glorious period in which our wrists were free

Old people used to write obnoxious thinkpieces about how people these days always wear watches and are slaves to the clock, but now they've switched to writing thinkpieces about how kids these days don't appreciate the benefits of an old-fashioned watch. My position is: The word 'thinkpiece' sounds like a word made up by someone who didn't know about the word 'brain'.

# Also, it's probably at least 2013.  Did you ever take that trip to Iceland?

Man:  Stop judging me!Maybe I haven't been to Iceland because I'm busy dealing with YOUR crummy code.

My Phone is Dying

Beret guy: My phone's about to die.


Figure: Where'd you get a big iPhone? I didn't think they were out yet.
Beret guy: It's my regular one. It's just dying.


Beret guy: As it consumes its battery, it heats up and expands. Soon it will swell to enormous size, engulfing us both.


Beret guy: Then it will collapse in a violent explosion!
Figure: ... Do you want to borrow my charger?
Beret guy: That would only make it run out faster!

When it explodes, it will cast off its outer layers, leaving behind nothing but a slowly fading PalmPilot, calculator, or two-way pager.

Conversation

Figure: So, what do you do in your free time?


Woman: Mostly I sit around worrying someone will ask me that, and try to think of a good answer.


Figure: That's not a bad answer.
Woman: It's all I've got. Now that it's done, I should go. Bye!

Later, at home: 'Dear diary: Still can't figure out what to write here ...'

En Garde

Left fencer: En garde!
Right fencer: OK.

Right fencer: No matter how long we know each other, when you ask 'What are you thinking,' I will always pause before answering.

Left fencer: Maybe a little less guarded?
Right fencer: No way. I've been hurt before.

'Touch!' 'Nope, I sighed and stared at you with resignation, so I regained emotional right-of-way.'

Figure: When a user takes a photo, the app should check whether they're in a national park...

Woman programmer: I'll need a research team and five years.
In CS, it can be hard to explain the difference between the easy and the virtually impossible.

Marriage


People often say that same-sex marriage now is like interracial marriage in the 60s. But in terms of public opinion, same-sex marriage now is like interracial marriage in the 90s, when it had already been legal nationwide for 30 years.

The Sake of Argument



Woman: Just for the sake of argument, let's say that--
Man: -- wait, for the sake of what?


Woman ((off scene)): Argument.
Man: Ok, cool, that's totally a good reason to say something that's wrong.  Gotta have arguments.


Woman: I'm just playing devil's advocate.
Man: Ok. So you saw an argument where one side was the devil, and you were like 'man, that guy could use an advocate.'


Woman:  It's... why are you being so difficult?
Man: For the sake of argument.

Where Do Birds Go
{{Title text: Water
ice has a lot of weird phases. Maybe asking 'where do birds go when it rains' is like asking 'where does Clark Kent go whenever Superman shows up?'}}


Man:  'Where do birds go when it rains?' is my new favorite Google search.
Woman ((off scene)): Why:


Man:  It gives the answer, but also shows you an endless torrent of other people asking the same question.  Pages and pages of them, across regions and cultures.


Man:  I love the idea that somehow this is the universal question, the thing that unites us.  When it rains we wonder where the birds go, and hope they're staying dry.

Orb Hammer



Person 1: You know that glowing orb in the night sky?
Person 2: Yeah?
Person 1: Let's go hit it with a hammer until little pieces break off, then bring the pieces back and lock them in a closet.
Person 2: Sounds good!

The Apollo program was weird.Ok, but make sure to get lots of pieces of rock, because later we'll decide to stay in a room on our regular orb and watch hammers hold themselves and hit rocks for us, and they won't bring us very many rocks.

Higgs Boson



Person off scene: Tell us about your proposal.
Woman: We're requesting $3 billion in funding to find the Higgs Boson.
Person off scene: ... wait.  Didn't you already find it a year or two ago?
Man: Yes, well, um.


Woman: ... ok, this is embarrassing.
Man off scene: See, the thing is---


Person off scene: Don't tell us you lost it already.
Woman: Look.  In our defense it's really small.'Can't you just use the LHC you already built to find it again?' 'We MAY have disassembled it to build a death ray.' 'Just one, though.' 'Nothing you should worry about.' 'The death isn't even very serious.'

Rack Unit

Black hat guy: I've discovered something.

Black hat guy: Standard server rack units and standard beehive honeycomb frames are compatible. They're both 19 inches, with similar pitches.
Woman: Uh oh.


Black hat guy: I'm pleased to announce that today, for a few hours, Google led the world in datacenter honey production. Until their security people kicked me out.


Woman: I'm sorry your beekeeping career ended so quickly.
Black hat guy: I'll find a new datacentre. Turns out most colocation TOSes don't mention beehives.
Woman: I suspect that will soon change.

There's also nothing in the TOSes that says you can't let a dog play baseball in the server room!

Geese





Woman: To think... we're seeing light that left those geese centuries ago. By now, they could be long dead.


Figure: ... What? They're a few hundred yards away. I hear them honking.
Woman: Ah, yes. You're hearing how they once sounded.
Figure: You're very weird.
Woman: Or I was, long ago...

Anyway, that's a common misconception. Geese live for a long time; all the ones we can see will probably keep flying around for billions of years before they explode.

Chemistry


((Capital letter H with circles on each of the legs of the H))
Hydrogen can form four bonds.  It readily bonds with itself, and often exists as a crystal.
((Image of several letters H 'bonded' labeled crystalline hydrogen))

((Capital letter C with circles on each end of the letter))
Carbon can only form two bonds.  It readily bonds with hydrogen to form CÃ¢ÂÂH (mydrane) or itself.
((Image of two letters C linked labeled CÃ¢ÂÂ))
((Image of two letters C linked with a letter H between them labeled CÃ¢ÂÂH))

((Capital letter O))
Oxygen is inert, forming no bonds...

AI-Box Experiment

BH: What's in there?
SG: The AI-Box experiment.

[[A close up on the box, which is hooked up to the laptop with a USB cable. Writing on the box says 'Superintelligent AI - do not open.'}}
SG: A superintelligent AI can convince anyone of anything, so if it can talk to us, there's no way we could keep it contained.


SG: It can always convince us to let it out of the box.
BH: Cool. Let's open it.


SG: --
NO, WAIT!!



AI: (in a wavy speech bubble filled with outer space, in a white serif font) hey. i liked that box. put me back.

fMRI

Person: Our fMRI study found that subjects performing simple memory tasks showed activity in the parts of the brain associated with loud noises, claustrophobia, and the removal of jewelry.

They also showed activation in the parts of the brain associated with exposure to dubious study methodology, concern about unremoved piercings, and exasperation with fMRI techs who won't stop talking about Warped Tour.

Curly: (typing) I had started to think I was asking too much, that I needed to settle. And then I found you half a world away.


Curly: (typing) I've been saving money. Six months from now, I'll be able to fly you here and support us for a while.

Trolley Problem

SG: Ever heard of the trolley problem?
BH: No. What is it?


SG: A trolley is barreling towards five helpless people on the tracks. You can pull a lever to direct it onto another track, but-


BH: Can I reach the lever without getting up?
SG: Wait, I'm not-
BH: In this scenario, how busy am I?


SG: I guess I forgot who I was talking to.
BH: For a dollar, I'll promise to pull the lever if one of the five people is you.

For $5 I promise not to orchestrate this situation, and for $25 I promise not to take further advantage of this ability to create incentives.

On the Moon

Person 1: If we could land a man on the moon, why can't we -
Person 2: - land a man on the moon?
Person 1: ...ok, fair. But we're working on it, ok?

"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on Venus and returning him safely to--" [an aide frantically whispers in the president's ear for a moment] "... of landing a man on Venus."

Feedback

Person 2: Why are you standing on a chair holding a pineapple?
Person 1:
I wasn't getting good reception but now I am!

The erratic feedback from a randomly-varying wireless signal can make you crazy.

A new study finds that if you give rats a cell phone and a lever they can push to improve the signal, the rats will chew on the cell phone until it breaks and your research supervisors will start to ask some questions about your grant money.

Small Moon

Luke: He's heading for that small moon.
Obi-Wan: That's no moon - it's a space station.


Luke: It's too big to be a space station.
Obi-Wan: But it's too
small
 to be a moon.




Obi-Wan: Fine! What if we agree it's not a moon, but we make a new category called 'dwarf moon'?
Luke: And what's the cutoff, asshole?! Is this
ship
 a dwarf moon now?
Obi-Wan: Screw you.


GENERAL JAN DODONNA: An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has reinvigorated the arguments of the 'artificial moonlet' and 'rogue planet-station' camps. I fear this question is fracturing the Rebellion.

Second character: No way.
Character: That mass must be going somewhere.
Second character: He has that magic bag...
Character: You think he poops in the bag of

Character: And what if no one's been

Second character: He picks at random.  The needs of the many...

He probably just poops over the side of the sleigh.

Bald character: We clean. Clean and clean and never stop.
Hair'd character: It won't be enough. We should just burn the place down for the insurance money.


Bald character: Isn't that wrong?
Hair'd character: My morality has evaporated under the harsh UV light.




Bald character: Ok, I'm googling insurance companies. Which one do you think pays the most?
Hair'd character: Let's just try calling around.

Hey, why stop at our house? We could burn down ALL these houses for the insurance money.

Gut Fauna

Doctor: I see the problem. Your gut macrobiome is out of balance.
Doctor: One moment.


Patient: I think you mean MICRObiome.
Patient: ..right?


Doctor: No. Here, swallow this.
Patient: That's a wolf.
Doctor: Do you need a glass of water?



I know it seems unpleasant, but of the two ways we typically transfer them, I promise this is the one you want.

Caption:If I could live anywhere, I would choose the example map from geography books that explains what everything is called.

The place I'd least like to live is the farm in the background of those diagrams showing how tornadoes form.

Location Sharing

Phone: This website wants to know your location.
Character: Allow.



Phone: This website wants to know your momentum.
Character: Deny. Nice try.

Our phones must have great angular momentum sensors because the compasses really suck.

Screws
((This comic is eight illustrated and labeled screw heads.))


Phillips head


Flat head


Uh oh. Maybe it's on amazon?


Cursed -1 phillips head.


Crap, it's a RIVET.


Phillips-head ruiner


Uranium screw (a real thing)


Phillip's head

If you encounter a hex bolt, but you only brought screwdrivers, you can try sandwiching the head of the bolt between two parallel screwdriver shafts, squeezing the screwdrivers together with a hand at either end, then twisting. It doesn't work and it's a great way to hurt yourself, but you can try it!

Technically

First character: Well, technically, food is a 'drug', since it's a substance that alters how your body works, so yes, I'm-
Second character: Hey, look at that weird bug!

Caption: My life improved when I realized I could just ignore any sentence that started with 'Technically'.

"Technically that sentence started with 'well', so--" "Ooh, a rock with a fossil in it!"

Ceres

Sitting character: 'Dawn' has almost reached Ceres.
Sitting character: I'm excited that we'll finally learn what that stupid white dot is.






Inspected by no. 6

Earth clearly hasn't been inspected, since it's definitely contaminated with salmonella.

Star Wars

Bald character: We're almost at the back to the future date.
Hair'd character: We're even closer to the star wars tipping point.
Bald character: The what?


       Return of the Jedi
       |        The phantom menace
       |        |          May 13th

Hair'd character: On may 13th, the phantom menace will have come out closer to return of the jedi than to the present
Bald character: Wow.

Bald character: It's weird how I'm constantly surprised by the passage of time when it's literally the most predictable thing in the universe.
Hair'd character (gazing into distance): You know, 'a long time ago' should have 'plus four more decades' added in rereleases.

A long, long time (plus 40 years) ago, in a galaxy far, far away (plus a corrective factor involving the Hubble constant) ...

P-Values
((A chart with two columns: P-value, which are numbers; and Interpretation, which are text labels. There are multiple numbers per label.))
((Each set of number values is described as a scene separated by commas, and their corresponding text label as 'text outside of dialogue'.))


Highly significant


Significant


Oh crap. Redo calculations.


On the edge of significance


Highly suggestive, significant at the P<0.10 level


Hey, look at this interesting subgroup analysis

If all else fails, use "significant at a p>0.05 level" and hope no one notices.

Troubleshooting

Hair'd character: Wait, why can't I click anywhere?
Bald character: I don't... ugh, it opened a dialog box offscreen.
Hair'd character: Why is that even POSSIBLE?
Bald character: It really shouldn't be. But you can fix it by changing your screen resolution to trigger a window cleanup.
Hair'd character: SERIOUSLY?
Bald character: I know, I know...

Caption: To be honest, I can't WAIT for the day when all my stupid computer knowledge becomes obsolete.

"Oh, you're using their Chrome APP, not their Chrome EXTENSION. They're very similar but one handles window creation differently." is a thing I hope I can stop saying soon.

Super Bowl

Character: I don't know much about sports, which can be culturally isolating, so it's tempting to get vocal and defensive about not following them.
Character: Caring about something makes people vulnerable, so NOT caring gives you power.


Character: But I know the things I'm into don't always sound interesting to 100% of the people around me, and it means a lot when they sometimes try to listen anyway--and maybe even find themselves sharing some of my excitement!

Character: So while everyone is going on about the super bowl on Sunday, let me tell you what I'LL be doing:

Character: Listening!
Character: Hooray for friendship!
Character (quietly): Also, eating snacks.
Character (quietly): Hooray for snacks!

My hobby: Pretending to miss the sarcasm when people show off their lack of interest in football by talking about 'sportsball' and acting excited to find someone else who's interested, then acting confused when they try to clarify.

Quotative Like

Figure A: I found this article on the linguistics of the 'Quotative Like'.
Figure B: Like when you're like, 'She was like'?
Figure A: Yeah.
Figure A: It features a quote from a linguist, Patricia Cukor-Avila: 'Eventually all the people who hate this kind of thing are going to be dead, and the ones who use it are going to be in control.'
Figure B: Wow. Turns out linguists are pretty hardcore.

Apollo Speeches


In 1969, Nixon staffer William Safire wrote a speech for the president to deliver if the Apollo 11 return launch failed, stranding the doomed astronauts on the moon.

Uncovered in 1999, it is often call the greatest speech never given.

Today, the full set of Safire's contingency speeches has been found.

((First speech))
In Event Astronauts Stranded On Moon
Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace.

In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.

Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts. For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Second speech))
In Event Spacecraft Goes Missing
Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins went to the moon as ambassadors of peace for all mankind, and all mankind prays that they may yet return safely home.

We are separated from the moon by a vast gulf of space, against which their tiny vessel appeared as but a drifting speck. For a few brief seconds, we took our eye off them, and despite days of desperate searching, never again was their vessel sighted from Earth.

While these men are lost they are not forgotten and their sacrifice will not-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Third speech))
In Event Astronauts Abscond With Spacecraft
We do not know what led Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins to betray the trust we placed in them, abandon their mission, and steer their vessel toward Mars. Nor do we know what compelled them to transmit such hurtful messages back to earth, heaping contempt on their onetime home.

But whatever the cause of their dereliction, I call upon the United States to commit itself, before this year is out, to launching a mission to chase down Apollo 11 and return its crew to face Justice. We must not rest until-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Fourth speech))
In Event Spacecraft Returns With Extra Astronauts
While this is much we do not understand, tonight all of Earth is united in celebrating the safe return of our brave explorers.

We of course have many questions, and in the day and weeks to come we will demand answers. How many souls were truly aboard Apollo 11 when it launched? Who are the six men now in quarantine aboard the USS Hornet? What happened-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Fifth speech))
In Event Spacecraft Hits U.S.S. Hornet, Crushing Nixon

President Agnew: Tonight, we have experienced a great national triumph and a great national loss. We take joy in the safe return from the moon of Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but that joy is tempered with sorrow as we mourn our president's tragic death beneath their wayward capsule.

Richard Nixon wholeheartedly supported our courageous astronauts as they carried the hopes and prayers of Earth to the heavens, and in the moment of their homecoming, he himself has departed on that ultimate voyage. As we grieve, we must rededicate ourselves to the cause for which our president-- <<notes are truncated>>

My fellow Americans, I am as shocked and appalled as you at this stunning and-- <<notes are truncated>>

Scienceer: No, I can't see a list of the atoms in a thing by looking.
Beret: How do you tell what things are?

Scienceer: This is ridiculous. Look at me. What do you see?
Beret: You have tons of metal in your face. Lots of fillings, I guess?

Scienceer: What's WRONG with you?

Beret: Too many zincs? I've always worried I had too much zinc and everyone thought I was weird.

Little-known fact: The 'Dawn of Man' opening sequence in 2001 cuts away seconds before the Flintstones theme becomes recognizable.

Dress Color
((Identical line drawings of a figure in a dress, but the bits are colored differently.))

((On the left, the figure appears serge blue on a royal blue background, and is wearing a sky blue and walnut brown dress.))

((On the right, the figure appears pale gold on a pale rose background, and is wearing a sky blue and murky green dress.))

((Between them is a series of stripes.))

This white-balance illusion hit so hard because it felt like someone had been playing through the Monty Hall scenario and opened their chosen door, only to find there was unexpectedly disagreement over whether the thing they'd revealed was a goat or a car.

Meeting
((An enthusiastic, beret-clad figure gives a presentation. A logo fills the background, it reads Company name dot website: If you're reading this, the web server was installed correctly. <<Trademark symbol>> ))
Beret: Welcome to a meeting! I'm almost out of words so I'll keep this short. Just wanna touch bases.

Beret: First, a few updates. We've learned from the state police that the self driving car project we launched by accident during this morning's carpool has come to an end about ninety miles outside of town. Very exciting!

Beret: Profits are up. Sales, any luck figuring out who our customers are?
Sales: Nope. Money keeps appearing, but we have no idea how or why.
Beret: Great!

Beret: Oh, and one last thing; I saw a cool red beetle in the hall. Can someone add it to the bug tracker?
Off panel: Just did!
Beret: Thanks!

Here at CompanyName.website, our three main strengths are our web-facing chairs, our huge collection of white papers, and the fact that we physically cannot die.

Insurance
((A figure seated at a desk is handing a document to a standing figure))

Seated figure: Here's a page explaining the terms of your new fire insurance policy.

((Standing figure regards the page thoughtfully, gripping it with both hands, really taking it in.))

Standing figure: Hey, what if I--
((Seated figure interrupts))
Seated figure: And HERE'S a page explaining that the, quote, cool hack, unquote, you just thought of is called, quote, insurance fraud, unquote. We already know about it and it's a crime.
Standing figure: Oh. Right. How did--
((Seated figure interrupts))
Seated figure: I see a lot of programmers here.

LIFEHACKS: You can just take all the luggage off the airport conveyer belt and leave with it. They don't check that it's yours at the door!

Hard Reboot
Figuring out why my home server keeps running out of swap space and crashing: one to ten hours

Plugging it into a light timer so it reboots every 24 hours: five minutes.

Googling inevitably reveals that my problem is caused by a known bug triggered by doing [the exact combination of things I want to do]. I can fix it, or wait a few years until I don't want that combination of things anymore, using the kitchen timer until then.

Art Project
((Four figures hold forth with expository monologue.))

Figure holding a camera: I'm doing an art project where I take a picture of myself every hundred years.

Figure holding a phone: I'm doing an art project where I take a picture of myself every one twenty-fourth of a second.

Figure pointing to their face: I'm doing an art project where you can come to my house and watch my actual face age in real time.

Figure holding a burrito to their face: I'm doing an art project where you all do those things while I eat a burrito.

It's my most ambitious project yet, judging by the amount of guacamole.

New Products
((There are no pictures. It is a table)

Title: Predicting the success or failure of a new product, based on what engineers and programmers are saying about it.

If they say it doesn't do anything new, or why would anyone want that: it means the product will be a gigantic success.

If they say it's really exciting! or I've already preordered one: the product will be a flop. years later, its ideas will show up in something successful.

If they say wait, are you talking about <unfamiliar person's name>'s new project?: the product could be a scam and may result in arrests or lawsuits.

If they say I would never put <company> in charge of managing my <whatever>: within five years, they will.

If you ever hear "Wait, is that Kim Dotcom's new project? I'm really excited about it and already signed up, although I'm a little nervous about whether everyone should hand over control of their medical...", it's time to dig a bunker in your backyard.

Terry Pratchett
((The text is written in an italic font, rather than hand-written, like it would be in a book. It goes across the top of the first four panels.))

I told her we were going to get married, and all she could talk about was frogs.
She said there's these hills where it's hot and rains all the time, and in the rainforests there are these very tall trees and right in the top branches of the trees there are these like great big flowers called . . . bromeliads, I think, and water gets into the flowers and makes little pools and there's a type of frog that lays eggs in the pools and tadpoles hatch and grow into new frogs and these little frogs live their whole lieves in the flowers right at the top of the trees and don't even know about the ground, and once you know the world is full of things like that, your life is never the same.

Upside-Down Map

((Cuba  is next to alaska, and alaska is touching the tip of south america, which is all near the equator. Mexico is now friends with greenland.

((Iceland, the UK, and asia are all close together. Japan and Taiwan haven't moved with the asian continent, and are technically European.))

If you live in the Northern hemisphere, anyway. In the southern hemisphere, due to the coriolis effect, babies are born nine months BEFORE they're conceived.

Code Quality

Amateur: Keep in mind that I'm self-taught, so my code may be a little messy.
Pro: Lemme see, I'm sure it's fine.


Pro: Wow. This is like being in a house built by a child using nothing but a hatchet and a picture of a house.


Pro: It's like a salad recipe written by a corporate lawyer using a phone autocorrect that only knew excel formulas.


Pro: It's like someone took a transcript of a couple arguing at ikea and made random edits until it compiled without errors.
Amateur: OKAY I will read a style guide.

I honestly didn't think you could even USE emoji in variable names. Or that there were so many different crying ones.

PermaCal

First: What day is it?
Second: Sunday the nineteenth.
First: But you said it was the nineteenth yesterday.
Second. It changed AGAIN? Crap, better add another leap day.

Caption: My new simplified calendar system assumes the date never changes, then corrects any drift via leap days.

The flood of PermaCalNTP leap-second notifications was bad enough, but when people started asking for millisecond resolution, the resulting DDOS brought down the internet.

Basketball Earth



Presenter: IF the earth were the size of a basketball,


Presenter: The moon would be--

Blackhat: Hey, cool!


Presenter: Um.


The earth's inhabitants: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA



Presenter: Let's try that again. If the earth were the size of a basketball,


Presenter: The moon would be--








Presenter: If the earth were the size of a basketball,


Presenter: The moon would...








Presenter: If the earth were the size of a basketball,


Presenter: The moon would, uh...






How many points do you get for dunking every basketball in existence at once?

Spectroscopy

Musical overture: I watch the sunlight


Musical overture: dance across your face


Musical overture: I can see you breathe

Although right now I'm more excited about ESPRESSO's radial velocity measurements, so I'm listening to This Kiss, her song about measuring "centrifugal motion" on "a rooftop under the sky".

Typical Morning Routine

<<BLEEP BLEEP>>
Person 1: Urgh.
Person 2: Your alarm is going off.
Person 1: Huh?
Person 2: Make it stop.
Person 1: Urrgh.


<<BLEEPEEP BLEEP BLEEP B>>
Person 2: Hit snooze.
Person 1: I'm
trying.
 I closed the alarm app and I can't... I'll just pop out the battery.
whoops!

<<CLANG>>


<<EEP BLEEP BLEEP BLE>>
Person 2: Make it stop!
Person 1: It... fell down the vent.


<<EP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLE>>
Person 2: Can you brick it remotely?
Person 1: Trying... I think I fumbled it into airplane mode?
Person 2: The battery could last for weeks.
Person 1: You know, maybe we should just move.

Hang on, I've heard this problem. We need to pour water into the duct until the phone floats up and ... wait, phones sink in water. Mercury. We need a vat of mercury to pour down the vent. That will definitely make this situation better and not worse.

Venus

Teacher: Venus was once temperate. It had seas and rivers, and Venusians cultivated vast fields of beautiful flowers.


Teacher: Until their greenhouses fled the planet due to the runaway greenhouse effect.


Teacher: The Venusians pursued their greenhouses to Earth, settling in the Netherlands and kickstarting the Dutch floral industry. Any questions?


Student: Because you're retiring in a month, do you just not care what you say anymore?
Teacher:
WHAT?!
 I
RIDE THE SKIES
 atop a screaming bird of truth! Also, yes, I do not.

The sudden introduction of Venusian flowers led to an explosive growth of unusual Earth pollinators, which became known as the "butterfly effect."

Degree-Off

Announcer: Welcome to the DEGREE OFF, where we determine which field is the best! Physics, wanna go first?
Physics: Sure! I'd like to tell the story of Richard Feynman's manhattan project lockpicking pranks..

Physics: ..and as he said 'All science is either physics or stamp collecting.' Thank you.
Announcer: Great! Bio, you wanna go next?
Biology: Okay.


Biology:This is a graph of the death rate from infectious disease in this country.


Biology: The heroes of my field have SLAIN one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.


Biology: While the heroes of YOUR field gathered in the desert to create a new one.

Physics: ...jeez, what the hell? I thought this was supposed to be fun and lighthearted!
Biology: YOU MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING OF STAMP COLLECTING.

I'M SORRY, FROM YOUR YEARS OF CONDESCENDING TOWARD THE 'SQUISHY SCIENCES', I ASSUMED YOU'D BE A LITTLE HARDER.

Sword in the Stone

Aethereal voice from above: THE THRONE OF ENGLAND IS YOURS


Smartphone: Wikipedia. England.



That seems like an awful lot of hassle when all I wanted was a cool sword.

Astronomy








Astrobiology is held back by the fact that we're all too nervous to try to balance on the ladder while holding an expensive microscope.

Microdrones

Standing: So how do we regulate all these micro drones? I mean, amazon delivery bots sound cool...


Standing: But I worry that overnight we'll realize we're surrounded by these things, no one will know who's controlling them, and then BAM, sci-fi dystopia.


Sitting: If you wanna slow it down, why not just remove all regulations, but then make drone theft legal?


Standing: ...I LIKE that.
Sitting: You write to congress. I'll stock up on butterfly nets.

Oh, weird, Amazon is out of butterfly nets.

Dimensions

Figure: Of the four dimensions I could have spent my life being pushed inexorably forward through, I guess 'Time' isn't the worst.

I would say time is definitely one of my top three favorite dimensions.

Emojic 8 Ball
EMOJIC 8 BALL





Placebo Blocker

Figure: Some reasearchers(hall et al, doi: 10.1015
molmed 2015 02 009) are starting to figure out the mechanism behind the placebo effect.
We've used their work to create a new drug: a placebo effect blocker.
Now we just need to run a trial! We'll get two groups, give them both placebos, then give one the real placebo blocker, and the other a... wait...



Audience: My head hurts.
Figure: Mine too. Here, want a sugar pill?

They work even better if you take them with our experimental placebo booster, which I keep in the same bottle.

Humans

UNIT ONE: You know, new research suggests ancient human kings and queens were covered in colorful fabric.

UNIT TWO: Ugh, I like MOVIE humans more. Screaming pink warriors with metal crowns poking through the skin on their heads!
Now they're, what, big pillows?
Science ruins everything.

At this point, if we're going to keep insisting on portraying dinosaurs as featherless because it's "cooler", it's time to apply that same logic to art involving bald eagles.

Vodka
[[Two figures sit at a table. One is IMBIBING from a large BOTTLE. The other is cradling what could be a cup of coffee, or a squarish bomb, or even a boxy of custom size condoms.

IMBIBER: Maybe this is the vodka talking, but:
HI! I'M MADE FROM POTATOES!

Or whatever's handy! I'm pretty much pure alcohol and water, so it doesn't really matter!

Keyboard Mash




WHG: Can't sleep. Stupid dogs keep barking.

FP: Ugh, I'm sorry. Maybe you could...
      ...OK, wait. I have to ask.
      How did you hit a '7' in the middle there?

WHG: Huh?
          I was just randomly keyboard mashing.

FP: Sorry, right.

WHG: Anyway,

FP: ...I know this is silly, but like... all your hands were clearly on the home row.
     I don't get how one finger could have stretched up to the '7.'

WHG: Why do you always fixate on these bizarre details?

FG: I don't know.
      Sorry.

WHG: It's weird, is all.


Spider:I am a normal human typing with my human hands.
FP: Yeah, of course.
      I know.

The BDLPSWDKS Effect

Ponytail: The Bernoulli-Dopper-Leidenfrost-Peltzman-Sapir-Whorf-Dunning-Kruger-Stroop Effect states that if a speeding fire truck lifts off and hurtles toward you on a layer of superheated gas, you'll dive out of the way faster if the driver screams 'RED!' in a
non
-tonal language that
has
 a word for 'firefighter' than if they scream 'GREEN!' in a
tonal
 language with
no
 word for 'firefighter' which you
think
 you're fluent in but
aren't.

This well-known effect has of course been replicated in countless experiments.

New Horizons

One: We made it! After all these years,
New Horizons
 is finally revealing the surface of Pluto!
Two: Take

One: Ok, who did the calculations for the Jupiter slingshot maneuver?
Two:
Dammit, Steve...


Last-minute course change: Let's see if we can hit Steve's house.

Antique Factory

WBG: Gotta go - I'm late for work.
Off-screen: Oh, where are you working now?
WBG: Antique factory!






WARNING: This item was aged by the same inexorable passage of time that also processes nuts.

Beer

1: What do you drink? Stouts? Lagers?
2: Uh, anything's fine.


2: ...do you ever think maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?


1: Man, you are no fun at all.
2: Ok, got it. Not a word.
1: Dude, if you don't like it, don't drink it.
2: No, no, gotta do my part! - Mmmmm!!!

Mmmm, this is such a positive experience! I feel no social pressure to enjoy it at all!

Words for Pets


First year: Primarily the pet's name, and sometimes words related to the pet.

Second year: Primarily words related to the pet, and sometimes the pets name or coherent words of any kind.

Third year: Words related to the pet, or coherent words of any kind, and sometimes not even that.

Fourth year onward: Terms which do not belong in any of the aforementioned categories.

Seventh year: Perfectly coherent words, but in the pet's language, not mine.

The Martian

SM: Ooh, trailer for
The Martian
!
WHG: What's that?
SM: Movie of a book I liked.
WHG: Should I read it?


SM: Depends. You know the scene in Apollo 13 where the guy says 'we have to figure out how to connect
this
 thing to
this
 thing using
this
 table full of parts or the astronauts will all die?'
WHG: Yeah?


SM:
The Martian
 is for people who wish the whole movie had just been more of that scene.
WHG: How on earth did
that
 become a big-budget thing with Matt Damon?
SM: No idea, but I'm
so
 excited.

I have never seen a work of fiction so perfectly capture the out-of-nowhere shock of discovering that you've just bricked something important because you didn't pay enough attention to a loose wire.

Planning

Ponytail: Why are people so comfortable handing Google and Facebook all this control over our lives?
Dark hair: I dunno. - Our species built thousands of nuclear weapons, scattered them around the planet, and then moved on to other things. - Maybe it's best to accept that some of this big-picture planning is just happening on autopilot.

Given the role they play in every process in my body, really, they deserve this award more than me. Just gotta figure out how to give it to them. Maybe I can cut it into pieces to make it easier to swallow ...

Strengths and Weaknesses

Interviewer: What would you say is your biggest weakness?

Applicant: Probably that I'm a giant tangle of parts that don't always work right, so I can die easily.

Interviewer: Biggest strength?
Applicant: There will come a day when I'm either an ancesotr to ALL living humans, or to NONE of them.

Interviewer: Where do you see yourself in five years?

90s Kid

child: Ugh, don't you hate how parents are all 'eat your carrots' and 'lol, remember Rugrats and Doug? Share if you're a 90's kid!'

Caption: The median age at first birth in the US is 25, which means the typical new mother is now a 90's kid.

We remember Rugrats, and think of them every time our kids look at us through their baby gates.

Character, thinking more: Maybe I should try posting my PRIVATE key instead.

I guess I should be signing stuff, but I've never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign.

Exoplanet Names 2

NASA has announced the discovery of a (super)earth sized planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star.

I suggest we name this planet 'pluto', both to celebrate the great work by the new horizons team, and to make the stupid 'is pluto a planet' debate a little more confusing.

While we wait to hear from the IAU, here's a revised and updated list of planet name suggestions, see xkcd.com

Second figure: It's one of my favorite halves.

The other half has some cool shipwrecks, rocks, and snakes, but if you move those out of the way, it also has more sky.

Pet owner: There's something wrong with my dog.
Pet owner: He keeps crawling around eating dirt.


Vet tech: This is a roomba.
Pet owner: Well, he's a mix.
Pet owner: Probaby some roomba in there.


Vet tech: A roomba is not a pet.
Pet owner: You're right. It's wrong to keep a beautiful creature like this in a house.


Pet owner: Go! Be free!

Roomba: WHIRRR

It's probably for the best. Since Roombas are native to North America, it's illegal for Americans to keep them in their houses under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

Driving

Black hat guy: Would you guess this weighs as much as a small adult?
Figure: What? Uh, probably.


black hat guy: great!


<<thump>>
Car: Please fasten your seat belt.
<<click>>
black hate guy: Take me to Anchorage, Alaska.
car: navigating.
<<slam>>
<<vrrrrrrrrr>>


black hat guy: I love self driving cars.
figure: ...whose car was that?
black hat guy: dunno, but they shouldn't have left it running.

Sadly, it probably won't even have enough gas to make it to the first border crossing.

There's no "I" in "VOWELS".

Every Seven Seconds

Thought: There's no way that's true.
Thought: It would interfere with basic cognition.
Thought: Such a ridiculous view of masculinity.
Thought: How would you even STUDY that?

Caption: Every seven seconds, sociologists think about that made-up statistic about how often men think about sex.

Every few months, I think about sex every seven seconds and how weird and implausible it would be.

Back Seat

Driver: Hang on, I just have to clear a few things out of the back.

Board Game

Randall: Now, this pile is 'Allowable deduction' cards. You match them with cards in your hand to preserve their full point value. Over here are 'dependent' tokens..

Yes, it took a lot of work to make the cards and pieces, but it's worth it--the players are way more thorough than the tax prep people ever were.

Kitchen Tips

Chef: If you're anything like me, you may have trouble telling when meat is fully cooked.
Chef: Instead of guessing, try a meat thermometer.


Chef: If you're anything like me, you probably throw away your plates and glasses when they get dirty. But if you clean them, they can often be used again!


Chef: Making scrambled eggs? Put a pan under them!
Chef: It's easier, and it keeps your burners cleaner.

[[Chef sprays a garden hose into the freezer side of a combination refrigerator

Chef: If you're anything like me, you make ice by spraying a hose into your freezer and then slamming it shut.

Household tip: Tired of buying so much toilet paper? Try unspooling the paper from the roll before using it. A single roll can last for multiple days that way, and it's much easier on your plumbing.

haircut: that's a cell tower.
beret: no way-- it has branches! See? I'm gonna climb it!


haircut: No, they just put those there to make it look-- ...never mind.


haircut: Why do I have no signal?
beret, with an axe: there were scary giants with yellow helmets in that tree! luckily, I cut it down before they ate me.

Since people rarely try to cut down cell phone towers, after millions of years, as cell phone towers have gotten more treelike, trees have started growing fake cell phone tower attachments and shiny gray bark to protect themselves. This is a standard textbook example of convergent evolution.

Engineer Syllogism

An engineer syllogism


Engineer: One, I am good at understanding numbers.


Engineer: Two, the stock market is made of numbers.


Engineer: Three, therefore, I-- WOW where did all my money just go?

The less common, even worse outcome: "3: [everyone in the financial system] WOW, where did all my money just go?"

Cyberintelligence

Scientist: Our overall fiscal year 2015 cyberintelligence budget was eight point one billion-
Scientst2: Yet it wasn't enough to pick up on the fact that no one else has used the prefix 'cyber-' for like a decade?
Scientist: Shut up.

We had gathered that raw information, but had yet to put it all together.

Trouble for Science

Footprints

2: Start
1: Jesus carried me
1: I carried jesus
1: Jesus disappeared for an evening each time a new Twilight movie came out
3: Who was that guy?
5: Ducklings imprinted on jesus and followed him around
4: Got lost and followed our own footprints
1: Rode around with jesus in captured at-st
1: Hit quicksand patch. Jesus didn't make it :(
0: Went home

"There's one set of foot-p's cause I was totes carrying you, bro!" said Jesus seconds before I punched him.

I Could Care Less

Monologuer: ...anyway, I could care less.

Listener: I think you mean you COULDN'T care less. Saying you COULD care less implies you care at least some amount.

Monologuer: I dunno.


We're these unbelievably complicated brains drifting through a void, trying in vain to connect with one another by blindly flinging words out into the darkness.

Every choice of phrasing and spelling and tone and timing carries countless signals and contexts and subtexts and more,

and every listener interprets those signals in their own way.

Language isn't a formal system. Language is a glorious chaos.

You can never know for sure what ANY words will mean to ANYONE.

All you can do is try to get better at guessing how your words affect people, so you can have a chance of finding the ones that will make them feel something like what you want them to feel.

Everything else is pointless.

I assume you're giving me tips on how you interpret words because you want me to feel less alone.

If so, then thank you.

That means a lot.

But if you'r ejust running my sentences past some mental checklist so you can show off how well you know it,

then I could care less.

I literally could care less.

Squirrel: RIIIIING -- RIIIIIING


Person: Hello?

[[The squirrel bites down on the person's ear.]
<<CHOMP>>
Person: OW!


Person: ???

After a while, the squirrel starts making that beeping noise and doesn't stop until it hops back up onto the stump.

And when I think about it, a lot of "things I want to do" are just learning about and discussing new tools for tinkering with the chain.

Travel Ghost
transcribe


Lots of apps let you plan your tirps using real-time bus, train, and traffic data. They try to predict which route will be faster, but aren't always right.

Instead of just planning, my new app lets you send 'ghost' versions of you along different routes, simulating their travel using the real-time data.

That way, you can see which route turned out to be faster in practice. You can also race your past selves.


Ugh, lost to the bike ghost AGAIN.


Person: Hey, my key won't work.
Wife: I'm sorry, but we've decided to replace you. This floaty guy is much more punctual.
Person: But...


Children: Our NEW dad never misses our games!

Person: NOOOOOOOOOOO!

And a different ghost has replaced me in the bedroom.

Birthday
XKCd turns 10 years old this month. In light of last nights court ruling in Rupamarya v. Warner
Chappell Music Inc, I would just like to say:

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear XKCD
Happy birthday to you



I guess I need to apologize to my parents, friends, and the staff at Chuck E. Cheese's for all the times I called the cops on them.

Picture a Grassy Field

Picture a grassy field.
In the center sits a small, pale, big-eyed creature with the power to escape from any visualized scene and move freely through the brain that imagined it.
It glances around nervously and--
--whoops, where'd it go?
Sorry about that! Keep an eye out for it in your daydreams.

Wait, I can fix this. Picture another field. In the middle sits the only creature the first creature is afraid of. Now just-- wait, where did THAT one go?

NASA Press Conference

Spokesperson: That concludes the press conference. Any questions? - Yes, you, from... it just says 'The News'?


WB: Hi! I have a microphone so I'm real loud now. - How does this Mars data compare to data from other fields? Like medicine? Or sports?


Spokesperson: That question makes no sense.
WB: If there's water on Mars, is it ruined? - Or will it be okay when it dries out?
Spokesperson: Any
other
 questions?


WB: What were those guys hassling Luke in the Mos Eisley cantina trying to accomplish? I felt like I was supposed to understand that.
Spokesperson: Anyone
else
?
Other person: That's now my question, too.
Another person: Were they just picking a fight?
Other person: If so, why did...

Why are we spending billions to ruin Mars with swarms of robots when Elon Musk has promised to ruin Mars for a FRACTION of the cost?

Moments of Inspiration
Isaac Newton

<<BONK>>
Newton: Ow!


Newton: Aha!

Lise Meitner

Ball-thrower: Hey Lise, think fast!
<<CRASH>>


Lise: Oh no! My collection of porcelain atoms! --
...Hmm.


Charles Darwin

Mrs. Darwin: I gave our kids soda, but the ones with beaks always have trouble drinking it.
Mr. Darwn: I've noticed that...

Albert Einstein

Einstein: I wish your twin brother would stop shining lights at us from that train. I can barely see my clock! -
...Wait!


Charles, I just talked to John and Mildred, who run that company selling seeds and nuts, and their kids with MOUTHS are starving!

Similarities
Person 1: So it's a work of fiction about a well-known brand, written on the internet by an enthusiast, republished as a bestselling book, and then made into a movie?
Person 2: yup.



Person 1: Yeah, 'The Martian' and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' are basically the same book.
Person 2: 'Fifty Shades of Red'?
Person 1: Man, tell me you wouldn't read that.

I just came from The Martian, and I just have to say: Forget BB-8; I want a pet Sojourner! It's always been the cutest of our Mars rovers.

Keyboard Problems


Person 1: Keys on my keyboard keep failing, even when I boot from an external recovery disk.
Person 2: Sounds like it's hardware, then.



Person 1: Yeah... except the problem followed me from my last computer.
Person 2: You have the most bizarre tech issues.



Person 1: It must be spreading via keyboards. This one won't work with any computer now.
Person 2: When the robot apocalypse happens, I'm hiding out in your house. Any Skynet drones that come near will develop inexplicable firmware problems and crash.

In the future, a group of resistance fighters send me back in time with instructions to find the Skynet prototype and try to upgrade it.

Food Rule
Title: My food rule
Will eat: Red meat, pork, poultry, fish, fruit, vegetables, grains.
Won't eat: shrimp, oysters, squid.

Caption: I won't eat something if I have to google to figure out whether or not it has a face.

I won't eat invertebrates, because I can fight a skeleton, but I have no idea what kind of spooky warrior a squid leaves behind.

Hardware Reductionism

1: Your photos from the triathlon got so many more likes than mine.
2: Yeah - my phone is quad-core. Research shows that iPhones like yours have just two cores, so they have a hard time capturing scenes with three different events in them.

If we talked about phone hardware the way we talk about brain hardware.

My MRI research shows a clear correlation between the size of the parietal lobe--the part of the brain that handles spatial reasoning--and enjoyment of 3D DoritosÂ®.

Frankenstein
Like many people, I'm tired of nitpicking about Frankenstein's Monster's name.
Luckily,
Frankenstein
 is public domain.
Therefore, I present
XKCD'S

FRANKENSTEIN

[Lightning bolt]
(The monster's name)



Monster:
GRAAAR!

Doctor: Frankenstein is alive! I am a modern Prometheus!
Monster: RAAAAR!
Doctor: To be clear, your name is
Frankenstein
. Canonically.
Monster:
GRAAAAAR!
 The moon landings were faked!
Doctor: Wait, what?

~Fin.~
There. Feel free to call the monster 'Frankenstein.'
If anyone tries to correct you, just explain that this comic is your canonical version.
Thank you.


"Wait, so in this version is Frankenstein also the doctor's name?" "No, he's just 'The Doctor'."

Why did we even have that thing?

Bell's Theorem
t=0 nanoseconds
Person 1: This is called Bell's Theorem.  It was first-

((distance marker cross-panel indicating 5 meters between Person 1 and Person 2))

t=1 nanosecond
Person 2: Wow, faster-than-light communication is possible!

Bell's Second Theorem:  Misunderstandings of Bell's Theorem happen so fast that they violate locality.

The no-communication theorem states that no communication about the no-communication theorem can clear up the misunderstanding quickly enough to allow faster-than-light signaling.

Overthinking

Person 1: I found a study* that said water is good for you, but you should just drink it when you feel thirsty, and not go overboard.
White Hat Guy: Uh huh?
{{Footnote*: DOI:10.1097

JSM.0000000000000221}}

Person 1: Another study* found that prolonged sitting isn't necessarily bad for you, as long as you're also getting exercise.
White Hat Guy: Okay...
{{Footnote*: DOI 10.1093
ije
dyv101}}

Person 1:Now a study* claims that humans in pre-industrial societies stay up late, and sleep 6 or 7 horus a night, just like most people today.
White Hat Guy: Huh. So what you're saying is..
{{Footnote*: DOI: 10.1016
j.cub.2015.09.046}}

Person 1: Maybe we're overthinking it.
White Hat Guy: But what caused our modern epidemic of overthinking?! Plumbing? Or is it email?
Person 1: Modern? I bet the wheel was invented by someone overthinking 'pushing'.

{{Title text: On the other hand, it took us embarrassingly long to clue in to the lung cancer
cigarette thing, so I guess the real lesson is 'figuring out which ideas are true is hard.'}}On the other hand, it took us embarrassingly long to clue in to the lung cancer/cigarette thing, so I guess the real lesson is "figuring out which ideas are true is hard."

Play-By-Play

Beret Guy: For those just joining us, hi! We're on part 5 of a hitting game.

Beret Guy: The next guy has a big bat, so he'll probably hit the ball real far.   huh?
{{
-
Wait- he missed!
-
Oh good, they're letting him try again.

Beret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy, but he's ignoring them. Wow.
-
Rude.

Beret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them.
-
It's just him though. None of his teammates are joining in.

Beret Guy: That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking!
-
Everyone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.
-
Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over.

The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail.

Human Subjects

Person 1: We're concerned that some of your results may be tainted by the fact that your human subjects are *awful*.
Person 2: What do you mean?

Person 1: Several participants in your drug trial were arrested for arson.
Person 2: Side effects can be unpredictable.
Person 1: They were in the control group.

Person 1: In your prisoner's dilemma study, 80% of the participants chose to betray their partners *before* the experimenter had a chance to tell them about the reward.
Person 2: Definitely troubling.

Person 1: In one experiment, your subjects repeatedly gave electric shocks to a stranger in another room.
Person 2: That's a famous psychological-
Person 1: This was a study of moisturizing creams!
Person 2: Yes, we're not sure how they snuck in all that equipment.


After meeting with a few of the subjects, the IRB actually recommended that you stop stressing out so much about safety guidelines.

30 Days Hath September

Person 1: ((thinking)) Thirty days hath September, April, June and November.  All the rest have 31- except February, which has 28, and leap year which makes it 29.
-
Wait, which month was I listening for? Oh right, October.
-
Did I say 'October' in there? Now i can't remember.
-
30 days hath September...

There's a cool mental calculation hack I recently learned for this: If you open the calendar app on your phone or computer, the highest-numbered box along the bottom is equal to the number of days in the month!

Launch Status Check

Announcer: T-minus 2 minutes
Controller 1: Tank and booster are go for launch.
Controller 2: Safety console?
Controller 1: Check. Safety-
Controller 2: Wait.


Controller 1: What is it?
Controller 2: On the live feed- a cool bird just flew past the tower!

Controller 1: Whoa, hat kind?
Controller 2: Like a hawk, maybe!
Controller 1: Could it be a vulture?
Controller 2: I doubt it. The wings were flat, not in a 'V'.
Controller 1: It could be an eagle!
Controller 2: Ooh!

Controller 1: This is launch control. We have a possible sighting of a cool bird. Halt the countdown.
Controller 2: Someone get binoculars up here!
Controller 1: I want to see!

Visual checks suggest the cool bird has exited the launch zone. Tip the rocket sideways and resume the countdown--we're gonna go find it!

Git

Person 1: This is git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model.
Person 2: Cool. How do we use it?
Person 1: No idea. Just memorize these shell commands and type them to sync up.
If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy.

If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.

Salvage








My hobby: Taking advantage of the rice myth by posting articles on "how to save your wet phone" which are actually just elaborate recipes for rice pilaf.

Water Delivery
Now that Amazon is advertising one-hour delivery of bottled water,

[[A diagram showing the most obvious progression of events.  First just one bottle is sent from the warehouse to a person.  Then two.  Then five.  Then 20.
Finally, a direct pipe sends the water along.]]

I vote we start calling municipal plumbing 'on-demand hyperloop-style water delivery' and see if we can sell anyone on the idea.

When I was a kid, I asked my parents why our houses didn't have toothpaste pipes in addition to water ones. I'm strangely pleased to see Amazon thinking the same way.

MarketWatch

Reporter:  Wild swings on the markets today as investors noticed the Dow was tracing out a silhouette of the D.C. Skyline, and everyone got too weirded out to break the pattern until they finished the Capitol Building.

Markets have been rocked by a second day of uncertainty after someone set up a giant Ouija board on the NYSE wall controlled collectively by the movement of the stock tickers.

Isolation
1840:

Person: The modern bookworm is too busy *reading* about the world to *look* at it.

1880:

Person: No one *talks* anymore- We take our daily newspapers in silence.

1910:

Person: The magazine is destroying conversation. We read even as we walk!

1960:

Person: Television has put an end to family discussion.

1980:

Person: Thanks to the Sony Walkman, anti-social isolation is now the norm.

2015:

Person: We've become too absorbed in our phones to notice the-
Person 2: *Dude*. It's been *two centuries*.
-
*Take a hint*.

2060: The gregarious superintelligent AI, happily talking its way out of a box, is fast becoming a relic of the past. Today's quantum hyper-beings are too busy with their internal multiverse sims to even notice that they're in boxes at all!

Linguistics Club

Person 1: You should come to our linguistics club's sesquiannual meeting.
-
Membership is open to anyone who can figure out how often we meet.

If that's too easy, you could try joining Tautology Club, which meets on the date of the Tautology Club meeting.

Flashlights

Person 1: Remember how flashlights sucked when we were kids? Always dim and finicky?
Person 2: I guess?


Person 1: Well, I discovered there are now internet flashlight enthusiasts.
-
And the technology has... improved.
Person 2: Ok, let's see.


<<FWOOSH>>

Person 1: See how it lights up the whole forest?
Person 2: ..the trees are on fire.
Person 1: Real bright, though.

Due to a typo, I initially found a forum for serious Fleshlight enthusiasts, and it turns out their highest-end models are ALSO capable of setting trees on fire. They're impossible to use without severe burns, but some of them swear it's worth it.

Snakes

Figure: Red touches yellow, which I think means this is a twenty-four-ohm snake.

The last band of color indicates the snake's tolerance for being held before biting.

DNA
White Hat Guy: Biology is largely solved. DNA is the source code for our bodies. Now that gene sequencing is easy, we just have to read it.
Person 2: It's not just 'source code'. There's a ton of feedback and external processing.

Person 2: But even if it were, DNA is the result of the most aggressive optimization process in the universe, running in parallel at every energy level, in every living thing, for four billion years.
White Hat Guy: It's still just code.


Person 2: Ok, try opening google.com and clicking 'view source'.
White Hat Guy: Ok, I- ...oh my god.
Person 2: That's just a few years of optimization by Google devs.  DNA is thousands of times longer and way, *way* worse.
White Hat Guy: Wow, biology is *impossible*.

Researchers just found the gene responsible for mistakenly thinking we've found the gene for specific things. It's the region between the start and the end of every chromosome, plus a few segments in our mitochondria.

Supreme Court

Newsreader: Breaking news: the Supreme Court has ruled 9-1 that they don't know who this guy is or how he got in here, but he's definitely
not
 a justice.

Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy called the man's arguments that he could be either Alito or Ginsburg "surprisingly compelling, but ultimately unconvincing."

Hoverboard
My new book, Thing Explainer, comes out today! To celebrate, here's a small game.

[[A stick figure on a hoverboard can navigate around a field with platforms and barriers, reminiscent of a pinball machine, from top to bottom and left to right. Along the way it can collect coins, and then deposit them in a little terminal down at the center of the bottom. When you do, a message reads, 'You got X coins in Y seconds!' and a secondary message depending on how well you did.
X=0 'You successfully avoided all the coins!'
X=1 'It's a start.'
X=2-4 'Not bad.'
X=5-9 'Terrific!'
X=10-16 (No message.)
X=17 'You found all the coins! Great job!'

However, if you leave the bounds of the playing field in either direction, a message in large red letters will flash:
RETURN TO THE PLAY AREA

When you keep going, you discover a vast world with grassy fields, caverns, mountains, volcanoes, and buildings. There are many little vignettes hidden everywhere, along with more coins.]]
Return to the play area

Food Combinations
If anyone tries this on you, the best reply is a deadpan "Oh yeah, that's a common potato chip flavor in Canada."

Fire Ants
Here in the entomology department, we have a simple two-step formula for answering any question: (1) ants are cool, and (2) we forgot the question because we were thinking about ants.

Baking Soda and Vinegar
Figure: You know what's actually really good? FOOD and FOOD.
Figures: Huh. I guess I can see it.
Caption: FUN FACT: If you say 'YOU KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD?' in the right tone of voice, you can name any two individually-good foods here and no one will challenge you on it.
List of foods: Ice cream, ham, relish, pancakes, ketchup, cheese, eggs, cupcakes, sour cream, hot chocolate, avocado, skittles.

Sure, it may not meet science fair standards, but I want credit for getting my baking soda and vinegar mountain added to the Decade Volcanoes list.

Colds
Student: I'm having second thoughts about grad school and could use some advice.
Professor: Consider the fire ant. When there's a flood, fire ants survive by joining together into giant floating rafts.
Student:
Student: Wait, what lesson am I supposed to take from that?
Professor: Ants are SO COOL!
Student: you're not big on metaphors, are you.
Professor: I am big on ants.

The contagious period ends right around when you start to sound sick over the phone, which is probably evidence of cold viruses evolving to spread optimally in the workplace.

The Three Laws of Robotics

Person 1: My science project is a baking soda and vinegar volcano!

Person 2: Why do people make these? It isn't really a science project. It doesn't teach anything about-
<<FOOM>>


Person 1: See how the baking soda and vinegar mix with mud and ice to form deadly flowing lahars?


Person 1: You can see the tiny cars trying to flee.
-
Whoops! Too slow.

Person 2: Um. This is a bit grim.
Person 1: Learning!

<<RUMBLE>>

Person 1: And now we're learning that this volcano is an offshoot of a vinegar hotspot rising from deep within the earth.
-
annnd...

<<BOOM>>


Person 1: The baking soda supervolcano erupts, injecting clouds of salt into the stratosphere

Person 3: Why is it getting dark outside?
Person 1: Learning is fun!

Person 1: Sunlight dims. The earth cools. Summer frosts form. Crops die. We check the markets. Grain prices are rising.

Person 3: I want to stop learning now.
Person 1: Soon, we all will.

In ordering #5, self-driving cars will happily drive you around, but if you tell them to drive to a car dealership, they just lock the doors and politely ask how long humans take to starve to death.

That guy only drives an alkaline car to overcompensate for his highly acidic penis.

Lunch

Person: I love kites.
Prankster: Hey, me too!
Prankster: I'll go get mine once I finish walking my dog! C'mon boy.



I'm trying to be healthier, so after I eat this brick of cheese, I'll have a spoonful of grease-soaked vegetables.

Time Capsule

Person 1: I bet he just drives that car to overcompensate for his cyan penis.

Oh no, I changed the future and now I'm disappearing! Wait, never mind, it was just my hat slipping down over my eyes.

Cold Medicine

Figure: What're you having for lunch?
Other figure: The usual - half a pound of cheese, white bread, a glass of tomato sauce, and some salt.
Figure: Eww.
Pizza seems way grosser if you imagine eating just the ingredients.

Seriously considering buying some illegal drugs to try to turn them back into cold medicine.

Watson Medical Algorithm

Woman: All right, let's open the time capsule.


Beret guy: Hi!
Woman: Where did you come from?!
Beret guy: The past! I traveled here in this time machine.

Figure: How did you... get here from the past?
Beret guy: I dunno. I couldn't not.
Figure: But... what did you eat?
Beret guy: Newspapers, mostly.


Beret guy: Anyway, I'm here to kill Hitler.
Woman: But he died long ago!
Beret guy: Oh, good! That was easy. Want to get sandwiches? Do you still have sandwiches?

Due to a minor glitch, 'discharge patient' does not cause the algorithm to exit, but instead leads back to 'hunt down and capture patient'.

Figure: Just gimme one of every kind of cold medicine you need ID to buy.
Shopkeeper: You'll go on the watchlist for-

Person 2: What was the Santa dial set to before?
Person 1: I forget.
Person 2: I'll just guess.

I've got the Craigslist post ready to go! I wasn't sure what category it should go in, so I listed it as property and put that it has 'good sun exposure.'

2016 Conversation Guide
The real loser in an argument about the meaning of the word 'hoverboard' is anyone who leaves that argument on foot.

2016

Woman: One day a year, the sun sets directly between these two trees.
Figure: Oh, cool - like the Manhattan thing.




Figure: Wait, isn't that true every day for pretty much any two trees?
Other woman: Shh, here it comes!


Figure: Wait, what?
Woman: OK, Got the bag?
Other woman: Yup, grab it!
Woman: We're gonna be rich!

Want to feel old? Wait.

It's 2016 - where's my...

Moon colony Ã¢ÂÂ No one has put up the cash
Self-driving car Ã¢ÂÂ Coming surprisingly soon
Floating sky city Ã¢ÂÂ Turns out cities are heavy
Hoverboard Ã¢ÂÂ This question is now ambiguous thanks to a new scooter thing (and will lead to an argument about the meaning of 'hoverboard' which is way less interesting than either kind of hoverboard)
Robot butler Ã¢ÂÂ He was called 'Jeeves' and he wasn't that great

Within a few minutes, our roads will be full of uncontrollably-swerving cars and our skies full of Amazon delivery dogs.

Judgment Day

<<Crash>>
Ceiling figure: Want to feel old? Night At The Museum, Cars, Hips Don't Lie, and the Wii all turn 10 this year. Twister, Independence Day, The Rock, PokÃ©mon, and Wonderwall all turn 20. And-
Hat guy: Oh my God, couldn't you at least have waited until morning?
Ceiling figure: It's been 2016 for hours! Time is passing!
Hat guy: I am acutely aware.

It took a lot of booster rockets, but luckily Amazon had recently built thousands of them to bring Amazon Prime same-day delivery to the Moon colony.

Computer voice: Oh my God, why do you even have all these? What's wrong with you? We're launching them into the sun.
The moment the computers controlling our nuclear arsenals become sentient

In the latest round, 9-year-old Muhammad Ali beat 10-year-old JFK at air hockey, while Secretariat lost the hot-dog-eating crown to 12-year-old Ken Jennings. Meanwhile, in a huge upset, 11-year-old Martha Stewart knocked out the adult Ronda Rousey.

Tools

Person 1: This video looks fake to me.
Person 2: Woosh
Person 1: Huh? Everyone's acting like it's real!
Person 1: If it's a joke lots of people aren't getting it.
Person 1: What am I missing?!!
Person 1: Answer me
Nothing creates more confusion than my bot that replies to random internet comments with 'Woosh.'

Quadcopter

Figure: Magnus Carlsen has an app where you can play chess against a simulated version of him at different ages. I can beat the 8Â½-year-old, but lose to him at 9.

Woman: I want that, but for other games. Can I beat 8-year-old Serena Williams at tennis? Swim laps faster than a 6-year-old Michael Phelps?
Figure: We should make a simulator.

Figure: ...Why limit it to games? Can I cook a better chicken than 11-year-old Martha Stewart?
Woman: Win an election against 12-year-old JFK?


Soon...
Woman: Looks like 8-year old Magnus Carlsen can swim faster than 9-year-old Martha Stewart.
Figure: But they both lose a hot-dog-eating contest to 2-year-old Secretariat.
Woman: This project has gotten weird.

I always have to turn off nature documentaries when they show these scenes.

Figure: What do you do?
Woman: I make tools that make tools

Woman: ... that monitor code that deploys tools that build tools for deploying monitors...

20 minutes later...
Woman: ... for monitoring deployment of tools for-
Figure: But what's it all for?
Woman: Honestly, no idea. Porn, probably.

Instructor: Welcome to Quadcopter-flying school.


Instructor: Today, we'll be learning the basics of- ... uhh...


Instructor: Um




Woman 1: Should we have helped?
Woman 2: No. It's cruel, but we have to let nature take its course.

I hope that somewhere in the world, "Panamax" is the last option on a "size" drop-down menu on a sex toy site.

Possible Undiscovered Planets

Bubble 1: 'This seems to be taking longer than usual-'
Bubble 2: '- Try reloading Gmail if the problem persists.'
Bubble 3: '- Maybe we should just go to bed.'

Superman lies near the bird/plane boundary over a range of distances, which explains the confusion.

In Case of Emergency

Woman: A man, a plan, a god's 'nam tables, nitrate, tar, tinsel, Batman's dog: anal Panama.

I keep first aid kits in those emergency lockers. Sure, it's expensive to have them installed in the wall, but at least for those ones there's no need to pay extra for safety glass.

Birdsong
Maybe if I put it in a box for a while with a speaker playing some pleasant pastoral music, I can reprogram it.

Woman 1: So you've build this particle detector in a salt mine to block out cosmic rays?
Woman 2: Yes. That is definitely why.

Gravitational Waves


Hatfriend: Did you watch the super bowl?
Otherfriend: Yes, like a third of the counry.
Otherfriend:A fraction which is INCREASING despite media fragmentation

Hatfriend: Can't we just talk without your weird need to give context for everything?
Otherfriend: Sorry. I'll try.

Hatfriend: Sounds like Peyton Manning's probably going to retire.
Otherfriend: Yes, I.. it..
Hatfriend: C'mon, you can do it!
Otherfriend: He..

Otherfriend: MAMMALS LIKE PEYTON AGE VIA A PROCESS TAHT INVOLVES BOTH THE ACCUMULATION OF DAMAGE AND POORLY-UNDERSTOOD TIMED FACTORS. YET THE CONCEPT OF RETIREMENT ITSELF IS SURPRISINGLY RECENT-
Hatfriend: Okay, good try. Maybe next year.

Event: Meet lonely singles in the local group tonight!

Some of you may be thinking, 'But wait, isn't the brightest star in our sky the Sun?' I think that's a great question and you should totally ask it. On the infinite tree of possible conversations spread out before us, I think that's definitely the most promising branch.

Toasts

Other: Hey, what's the temperature outside?
Person: (thinks) Should I give it in ÂºF or ÂºC?


DEGREES CELSIUS
Âinternational standard
Âhelps reduce America's weird isolationism
Ânice how 'negative' means below freezing
Âphysics major loyalty
Âeasier to spell
Âwe lost a Mars probe over this crap


DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
Â0ÂºF to 100ÂºF good match for temperature range in which most humans live
Ârounds more usefully (70's, 90's)
Âunit-aware computing makes Imperial less annoying
ÂSI prefixes less relevant for temperatures
ÂFahrenheit likely more clear in this context
Âvaluing unit standardization over being helpful possibly makes me a bad friend


Person: (thinks)Crap, gotta pick something. Uhh... (says) ...0.173 radians.
Other: I'll just go check myself.

Baby
Does it get taller first and then widen, or does it reach full width before getting taller, or alternate, or what?

Robotic Garage
But listen, if getting your car out from under the pile is REALLY important to you, we do have an axe you can borrow.

Conditionals

Person (thinking): Wow, it's getting so big! Unlike most babies, which stay the same size forever.
Hi! I'm talking to a baby!
What brand is it?
Wow, definitely much smaller than a regular person!
You sure did make that.
4
5 stars, Great baby.
It doesn't really look like you since you're not a baby.
So do they learn words one at a tie alphabetically or can you pick the order or what?
I hope it does a good job.
Person (says aloud): Wow, that's a really cool baby!
Person (thinks): Dammit.

I can never figure out what to say to babies.
'If you're done being pedantic, we should get dinner.' 'You did it again!' 'No, I didn't.'

United States Map

BHG: Just pull onto the receiving platform.
Driver: Cool - I've always wanted to try one of these futuristic robotic garages.




Driver: Um.




<<CRUNCH>>


BHG: We'll dump out the bin when you get back and you can pick out your car from the pile.
Driver: Can you at least make sure it's not on the bottom?
BHG: Look, robots aren't magic.

It would be pretty unfair to give to someone a blank version of this map as a 'how many states can you name?' quiz. (If you include Alaska and Hawaii, you should swap the Aleutian Islands with the Hawaiian ones.)

Insanity

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Doomsday Clock


Character: Oh hey, spring forward.





I looked up "insanity" in like 10 different dictionaries and none of them said anything like that. Neither did the DSM-4. But I'll keep looking. Maybe it's in the DSM-5!

Estimating Time

Woman: It begins.
Local News: Seagull steals phone, drops it in ocean
Protip: to make your day more dramatic, post a random minor news story with the comment 'It begins.'

Corollary to Hofstadter's Law: Every minute you spend thinking about Hofstadter's Law is a minute you're NOT WORKING AND WILL NEVER FINISH! PAAAAAANIIIIIIC!

Tire Swing

Hat guy: They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
Character: You've been quoting that clichÃ© for years. Has it convinced anyone to change their mind yet?

If we find one of those tire dumps, the next time he tries to get his truck back we can just retreat and let him have it.

Captain Speaking

Woman: Aaaa! I'm so bad at estimating how long projects will take.


Woman 2: Don't panic - there's a simple trick for that: take your most realistic estimate, then double it.
Woman: Okay, but:

Woman 2: Now double it again. Add five minutes. Double it a third time.
Woman: Okay...


Woman 2: 30 seconds have gone by and you've done nothing but double imaginary numbers! You're making no progress and will never finish!
Woman: Aaaaaa!
Woman 2: Paaaniiic!
Woman: Aaaaaaa!

Oh dang, you have to pay? Hey, has anyone else paid already? If so, can I borrow your phone for a sec?

Podium

Woman 1: OK, looks good.

Woman: I read that there are these huge dumps everywhere full of millions of old tires that no one knows what to do with.

Woman: We should use one of those next time.
Woman 2: Yeah. That guy was real mad.
Woman: I would not want to fight him again.

BREAKING: Senator's bold pro-podium stand leads to primary challenge from prescriptivist base.

Jack and Jill

Captain: This is your captain speaking. Gonna be honest - I just woke up and have no idea where I am. Looks like a Boeing of some kind? Oh hey, it says the flight number here. Okay, I'm gonna check Flightaware to figure out where we're going. Anyone know how to get on the wifi?

Jill and Jack / began to frack. / The oil boosts their town. / But fractures make / the bedrock shake / and Jack came tumbling down.

Figure: The American people are tired of politics as usual. They're tired of-
Figure: Okay, brief tangent: Is this thing a podium or a lectern? People say 'Podium' is wrong, but I also see it used that way in pretty formal contexts. Is usage just changing? If elected, I will get to the bottom of this once and for all.

I don't think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under 'Tourist Attractions.' It's not a museum--it's just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed.

There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control.

Singularity
((This strip is laid out like a Wikipedia contents table.))
I love reading the Wikipedia talk entries for articles on individual cities
Contents [hide]
1 Origin of city's name?
1.1 Idea for a better name
1.2 Not how Wikipedia works
2 Too much promotion of lake festival
3 Should we mention the murders?
3.1 Not that notable
3.2 All cities have murders
4 Quote verification: even if Voltaire did visit (unlikely), why would he get so angry about our restaurants?
5 Discuss: new picture
5.1 Current one looks awfully bleak
5.2 Gray sky
5.3 What about this one
5.4 Also bleak
5.5 Maybe this place just looks that way
5.6 Found a better picture, more colourful
5.7 That's a shot from Disney's Zootopia
6 'Mining disasters' section too long
6.1 Not really Wikipedia's fault
6.2 Why is this town so bad at mining?
7 Infobox picture: I just realised you can see a murder happening in the background
7.1 This city is terrible
7.2 Photoshopped out murder
7.3 Can someone just take a better picture
7.4 Okay, uploaded a new picture
7.5 Wait, never mind, I just noticed there's a murder in this one, too
8 1982 secession still in effect?
9 I think the murderer is reverting my edits
10 Why does this article take any position on correct condom use, let alone such a weird and ambiguous one?
11 Train station 'designed by Andrew Lloyd Webber'?
11.1 They probably mean Frank Lloyd Wright
11.2 I thought so too, but it's apparently not a mistake
11.3 Didn't know he did architecture
11.4 Roof collapse

I figured that now that society has collapsed, I wouldn't need to wear clothes anymore, but apparently that violates some weird rule of quantum gravity.

No, a hydroplane doesn't land on water--that's an aquaplane. A hydroplane is a plane that gets electric power from an onboard water reservoir with a tiny dam and turbines.

Figure: Can I just print a copy of the file I was-
Laptop: Nope!








Phone: Hi!
Figure: Phone? You're still here?


Phone: I was not a true believer. Now, together, we must face the tribulation!
Figure: Okay, cool. I'm gonna go look for a book or something, but yell if you need me, I guess.

Learning arcane bullshit from the 80s can break your computer, but if you're willing to wade through arcane bullshit from programmers in the 90s and 2000s, you can break everyone else's computers, too.

Women on 20s

Figure 1: What's that airplane?
Figure 2: Oh, that's a Boeing Q404 twin-engine quad-band mig-380 hybrid dual-wield Mk. IVII turbodiesel 797 hydroplane.
I've always assumed I'm one of those people who knows a lot about planes, but I've never actually checked.

I get that there are security reasons for the schedule, but this is like the ONE problem we have where the right answer is both easy and straightforward. If we can't figure it out, maybe we should just give up and just replace all the portraits on the bills with that weird pyramid eye thing.

Timeline of Bicycle Design

Black hat guy: Okay, hold still. And remember, if you really believe in the laws of physics, you won't flinch.

I'll be honest--the 1950s were a rough time for cycling.

Adult
((This comic is a 1D chart, from least to most willing, of tolerance to deal with technical arcana. A stick figure labelled 'me' stands at the central point.))
Willingness to wade through some 80's programmer's arcane bullshit:
Low: Never learn to program
Me: Learn enough to break everything but not enough to fix it
High: Spend all your time compiling kernels and never make anything

Figure: ((thinking)) Applying for a mortgage! As if I'm a real grown-up.

Using a classic Timothy Zahn EU/Legends novel is bad enough, but at least the style and setting aren't too far off. If you really want to mess with people, try using Splinter of the Mind's Eye.

Glacial Erratic
"This will take a while, which sucks, because I'm already so busy chiseling out igneous intrusions from rock formations and watching Youtube loops of the Superman fault-sealing scene over and over."

Decades
In the 90s, our variety radio station used the tagline "the best music of the 70s, 80s, and 90s." After 2000, they switched to "the best music of the 80s, 90s, and today." I figured they'd change again in 2010, but it's 2017 and they're still saying "80s, 90s, and today." I hope radio survives long enough for us to find out how they deal with the 2020s.

Air Force Museum
I had fun visiting the museum at Dover Air Force Base, unless they don't have a museum, in which case I've never been to Delaware in my life.

Magnetohydrodynamics
Magnetohydrodynamics combines the intuitive nature of Maxwell's equations with the easy solvability of the Navier-Stokes equations. It's so straightforward physicists add "relativistic" or "quantum" just to keep it from getting boring.

Election Map
Luckily for my interpretation, no precincts were won by the Green Party.

Once Per Day
I'm not totally locked into my routineâtwice a year, I take a break to change the batteries in my smoke detectors.

Refresh Types
The hardest refresh requires both a Mac keyboard and a Windows keyboard as a security measure, like how missile launch systems require two keys to be turned at once.

Telephoto
I was banned from the airliners.net photography forum by concerned moderators after the end of my lens started brushing against planes as they flew by.

Existence Proof
Real analysis is way realer than I expected.

Emoji Movie
Some other studio should do the Antz/A Bug's Life thing and release The Dingbats Movie at the same time.

4th of July
Strangely, they still celebrate by eating hot dogs. Since they don't have mouths, they just kinda toss them in the air and let them fall back down into their propeller blades. It's pretty messy.

Sports Knowledge
I heard they might make the wild card game, which would be cool. Do you know when that is? I have a wedding next weekend, but if it's after that we could try to go!

Communicating
You're saying that the responsibility for avoiding miscommunication lies entirely with the listener, not the speaker, which explains why you haven't been able to convince anyone to help you down from that wall.

Quantum
If you draw a diagonal line from lower left to upper right, that's the ICP 'Miracles' axis.

Particle Properties
Each particle also has a password which allows its properties to be changed, but the cosmic censorship hypothesis suggests we can never observe the password itselfâonly its secure hash.

Screenshots
For the final exam, you take a screenshot showing off all the work you've done in the class, and it has to survive being uploaded, thumbnailed, and re-screenshotted through a chain of social media sites.

City Nicknames
This place has so many demonyms. Northlanders. Fair Folk. Honey Barons. Lake Dwellers. Treasurers. Swamp Watchers. Dream Farmers. Wellfolk. Rockeaters. Forgotten Royals. Remote Clients. Barrow-Clerks. The People of Land and Sky.

Wifi vs Cellular
According to the cable company reps who keep calling me, it's because I haven't upgraded to the XTREME GIGABAND PANAMAX FLAVOR-BLASTED PRO PACKAGE WITH HBO, which is only $5 more per month for the first 6 months and five billion dollars per month after that.

Russell's Teapot
Unfortunately, NASA regulations state that Bertrand Russell-related payloads can only be launched within launch vehicles which do not launch themselves.

Physics Confession
"You know lightning, right? When electric charge builds up in a cloud and then discharges in a giant spark? Ask me why that happens." "Why does tha--" "No clue. We think it's related to the hair thing."

Eclipse Flights
The captain has turned on the 'fasten seat belt' sign.

Positive and Negative Reviews
This restaurant is great! I was feeling really sick, but then I ate there and felt better!

Emoji Movie Reviews
There's this idea that emoji are bad for communication because they replace ambiguity and nuance with a limited set of preselected emotions, but it doesn't really survive a collision with real-world usage of the thinking face or upside-down smiley.

Bun Alert
Since buns range from crepuscular to nocturnal, it's recommended that you enable the scheduled "Do Not Disturb" mode on your phone to avoid being woken by alerts about Night Buns.

Backup Batteries
If it falls below 20% full, my bag turns red and I start to panic.

Email Reply
I would be honored, but I know I don't belong in your network. The person you invited was someone who had not yet inflicted this two-year ordeal upon you. I'm no longer that person.

Geologic Faults
I live on a torn-bag-of-potato-chips-where-the-tear-is-rapidly-growing fault, which is terrifying.

Computers vs Humans
It's hard to train deep learning algorithms when most of the positive feedback they get is sarcastic.

Eclipse Searches
There were traffic jams for the eclipses in 1970 and 1979, and that was *before* we had the potential for overnight viral social media frenzies.

Eclipse Science
I was thinking of observing stars to verify Einstein's theory of relativity again, but I gotta say, that thing is looking pretty solid at this point.

Earth Orbital Diagram
You shouldn't look directly at a partial eclipse because of the damage that can be caused by improperly aligning the solar-lunar orbital plane with the orbital bones around your eye.

Eclipse Birds
'Hey! Put her down!' 'No, it's ok! The next chance for me to be carried to a blood cauldron isn't until 2024!'

Eclipse Review
I watched from a beautiful nature reserve in central Missouri, and it was--without exaggeration--the coolest thing I've ever seen.

Drone Training
The joke will be on him in a few weeks when animal control shows up and takes custody of his Roomba.

Color Models
What if what *I* see as blue, *you* see as a slightly different blue because you're using Chrome instead of Firefox and despite a decade of messing with profiles we STILL can't get this right somehow.

Supervillain Plan
Someday, some big historical event will happen during the DST changeover, and all the tick-tock articles chronicling how it unfolded will have to include a really annoying explanation next to their timelines.

Ringer Volume/Media Volume
Our new video ad campaign has our product's name shouted in the first 500 milliseconds, so we can reach the people in adjacent rooms while the viewer is still turning down the volume.

Ensemble Model
I'm in talks with Netflix to produce an alternate-universe crime drama about the world where sliced bread was never re-legalized, but it's going slowly because they keep changing their phone numbers and the door lock codes at their headquarters.

Typing Notifications
Over the years I've decided I'd rather have them on than not, but I'm glad there aren't "has opened a blank note to compose a reply to you" notifications.

Two Down, One to Go
The third row will probably have to wait until 2034, and maybe longer. If I see a daytime supernova, I'll replace the meteor storm with that and consider it 3/3.

Still in Use
'Which one?' 'I dunno, it's your house. Just check each object.' 'Check it for *what*?' 'Whether it looks like it might have touched a paper towel at some point and then forgotten to let go.' '...' 'You can also Google to learn how to check which things are using which resources.' 'You know, I'll just leave the towel there and try again tomorrow.'

xkcd Phone 6
We understand your privacy concerns; be assured that our phones will never store or transmit images of your face.

What to Bring
I always figured you should never bring a gun to a gun fight because then you'll be part of a gun fight.

Obsolete Technology
And I can't believe some places still use fax machines. The electrical signals waste so much time going AROUND the Earth when neutrino beams can go straight through!

USB Cables
Tag yourself, I'm "frayed."

Thread
Since the current Twitter threadfall kicked off in early 2016, we can expect it to continue until the mid 2060s when the next Interval begins.

Real Estate
I tried converting the prices into pizzas, to put it in more familiar terms, and it just became a hard-to-think-about number of pizzas.

Worrying Scientist Interviews
They always try to explain that they're called 'solar physicists', but the reporters interrupt with "NEVER MIND THAT, TELL US WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE SUN!"

Active Ingredients Only
Contains the active ingredients from all competing cold medicines, plus the medicines for headaches, arthritis, insomnia, indigestion, and more, because who wants THOSE things?

Self Driving
"Crowdsourced steering" doesn't sound quite as appealing as "self driving."

October 2017
And yet I have no trouble believing that the start of the 2016 election was several decades ago.

Ears
My theory is that most humans have been colonized with alien mind-control slugs that hold the earbuds for them, and the ones who can't wear earbuds are the only surviving free ones.

Jet Lag
I had some important research to do on proposed interstellar space missions, basketball statistics, canceled skyscrapers, and every article linked from "Women in warfare and the military in the 19th century."

Logical
It's like I've always said--people just need more common sense. But not the kind of common sense that lets them figure out that they're being condescended to by someone who thinks they're stupid, because then I'll be in trouble.

State Borders
A schism between the pro-panhandle and anti-panhandle factions eventually led to war, but both sides spent too much time working on their flag designs to actually do much fighting.

Bun Trend
Our experts have characterized the ecological impact of this trend as "adorable."

Research Risks
The 1919 Great Boston Molasses Flood remained the deadliest confectionery containment accident until the Canadian Space Agency's 2031 orbital maple syrup delivery disaster.

Cast Iron Pan
If you want to evenly space them, it's easiest to alternate between the Arctic and Antarctic. Some people just go to the Arctic twice, near the equinoxes so the visits are almost 6 months apart, but it's not the same.

Making Progress
I started off with countless problems. But now I know, thanks to COUNT(), that I have "#REF! ERROR: Circular dependency detected" problems.

Immune System
It also helps with negotiation. "Look, if it were up to me, *I'd* accept your offer, but my swarm of autonomous killer cells literally can't be reasoned with. It's out of my hands!"

Credit Card Rewards
I should make a list of all the things I could be trying to optimize, prioritized by ... well, I guess there are a few different variables I could use. I'll create a spreadsheet ...

Digital Resource Lifespan
I spent a long time thinking about how to design a system for long-term organization and storage of subject-specific informational resources without needing ongoing work from the experts who created them, only to realized I'd just reinvented libraries.

Sky Spotters
Where I live, one of the most common categories of sky object without a weird obsessive spotting community is "lost birthday party balloons," so that might be a good choiceâalthough you risk angering the marine wildlife people, and they have sharks.

Defensive Profile
NO DRAMA ZONE -> If I've made you sad, you'd better not tell me, because I am TERRIFIED of that situation and have NO IDEA how to handle it.

Thermostat
Your problem is so terrible, I worry that, if I help you, I risk drawing the attention of whatever god of technology inflicted it on you.

A ï¿½
If you want in on the fun, map a key on your keyboard to the sequence U+0041 U+0020 U+FFFD (or U+0021 U+0020 U+FFFD for the exclamation point version), and then no update can never take this away from you.

Twitter Verification
When we started distributing special status tokens that signify which people are important enough to join an elite group, we never could have imagined we might be creating some problems down the line.

Nightmare Email Feature
"...just got back and didn't see your message until just now. Sorry! -- TIME THIS MESSAGE SAT HALF-FINISHED IN DRAFTS FOLDER: 3 days, 2 hours, 45 minutes."

Temperature Preferences
There's a supposed Mark Twain quote, "The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco." It isn't really by Mark Twain, but I don't know who said itâI just know they've never been to McMurdo Station.

How to Make Friends
No, wait, come back! I want to be friends at you!

NEXUS
You also refuse to buy Cisco products because you hate the Thong Song, O. Henry, Deep Space Nine, freshwater whitefish, teenaged Incan emperors, Brak's brother, and vegetable-based shortening.

Interstellar Asteroid
Every time we detect an asteroid from outside the Solar System, we should immediately launch a mission to fling one of our asteroids back in the direction it came from.

Emoji Sports
No horse has yet managed the elusive Quadruple Crownâwinning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes, and the Missouri Horse Hole.

The Moon and the Great Wall
And arguably sunspots, on rare occasions. But even if they count, it takes ideal conditions and you might hurt your eyes.

Interferometry
It's important to note that while the effective size of the dog can be arbitrarily large, it's not any more of a good dog than the two original dogs.

Felsius
The symbol for degrees Felsius is an average of the Euro symbol (â¬) and the Greek lunate epsilon (Ïµ).

Solar Panels
This works for a surprising range of sunlit things, including rooftops (sure), highway surfaces (probably not), sailboats (maybe), and jets, cars, and wild deer (haha good luck).

Self-Driving Car Milestones
I'm working on a car capable of evaluating arbitrarily complex boolean expressions on "honk if [...]" bumper stickers and responding accordingly.

Bad Code
"Oh my God, why did you scotch-tape a bunch of hammers together?" "It's ok! Nothing depends on this wall being destroyed efficiently."

Tinder
People keep telling me to use the radio but I really hate making voice calls.

Seven Years
[hair in face] "SEVVVENNN YEEEARRRSSS"

Argument Timing
Of course, everyone has their own profile. There are morning arguers, hangry arguers, meal-time arguers, late-night arguers, and people who get in a meta-argument over what their argument timing is, dredge up examples of past arguments, and end up fighting over THOSE again as well.

Calendar Facts
While it may seem like trivia, it (causes huge headaches for software developers / is taken advantage of by high-speed traders / triggered the 2003 Northeast Blackout / has to be corrected for by GPS satellites / is now recognized as a major cause of World War I).

Virtual Assistant
If you ask it to please turn off that feature, it apologizes a whole bunch and promises to try to be quieter, then switches to a slightly lower-volume version of the clip with "sorry!" after the louder sounds.

The True Meaning of Christmas
They all made fun of Autometalogolex, but someday there will be a problem with Christmas that can only be solved if Santa somehow gets a serious headache, and then they'll see.

Santa Facts
We've gotten him up to 20% milk and cookies through an aggressive public campaign, but that seems to be his dietary limit. Anything above that and he starts developing nutritional deficiencies.

Phone Security
...wait until they type in payment information, then use it to order yourself a replacement phone.

2018
We should really start calculating it earlier, but until the end of December we're always too busy trying to figure out which day Christmas will fall on.

Desert Golfing
I just want to stay up long enough to watch the ball drop into the hole number 2018.

IATA Airport Abbreviations
IATA stands for International AirporT Abbreviation.

Meltdown and Spectre
New zero-day vulnerability: In addition to rowhammer, it turns out lots of servers are vulnerable to regular hammers, too.

2016 Election Map
I like the idea of cartograms (distorted population maps), but I feel like in practice they often end up being the worst of both worldsânot great for showing geography OR counting people. And on top of that, they have all the problems of a chloro... chorophl... chloropet... map with areas colored in.

The Food Size Cycle
There's data suggesting that this model may apply to deep-dish/thin-crust pizza. I've designed a thorough multi-year study to investigate this personally, but funding organizations keep denying my grant requests.

Dying Gift
And to you, I leave my life-sized ice sculpture replica of the PietÃ  which was blessed by the Pope. You must never let it melt! Now, remember, all gifts must be removed from my estate within 24 hours.

Memorable Quotes
"Since there's no ending quote mark, everything after this is part of my quote. âRandall Munroe

Universal Dreams
"That's ... unsettling." "Yeah, those definitely don't sound like the normal dreaâ ï¼¬ï¼¡ï¼´ï¼©ï¼´ï¼µï¼¤ï¼¥ ï¼´ï¼¨ï¼²ï¼¥ï¼¥ ï¼¦ï¼©ï¼¶ï¼¥ ï¼°ï¼¯ï¼©ï¼®ï¼´..."

The End of the Rainbow
The retina is the exposed surface of the brain, so if you think about a pot of gold while looking at a rainbow, then there's one at BOTH ends.

Scientific Paper Graph Quality
The worst are graphs with qualitative, vaguely-labeled axes and very little actual data.

Hawaii
Ok, I've got it, just need to plug in my security key. Hmm, which way does the USB go? Nope, not that way. I'll just flip it andâ OH JEEZ IT FELL INTO THE VENT.

Night Sky
There's a mountain lion nearby, but it didn't notice you because it's reading Facebook.

Campaign Fundraising Emails
The establishment doesn't take us seriously. You know who else they didn't take seriously? Hitler. I'll be like him, but a GOOD guy instead of...

Fruit Collider
The most delicious exotic fruit discovered this way is the strawberry banana. Sadly, it's only stable in puree form, so it's currently limited to yogurt and smoothies, but they're building a massive collider in Europe to search for a strawberry banana that can be eaten whole.

Chicken Pox and Name Statistics
People with all six of those names agree that it's weird that we have teeth, when you think about it for too long. Just about everyone agrees on that, exceptâin a still-unexplained statistical anomalyâpeople named "Trevor."

Super Bowl Watch Party
It's going to be weird near the end of May when the screen goes blank for over 18 hours.

Backpack Decisions
"This one is perfect in every way, except that for some reason it's woven from a tungsten mesh, so it weighs 85 pounds and I'll need to carry it around on a hand cart." "That seems like a bad--" "BUT IT HAS THE PERFECT POCKET ARRANGEMENT!"

The History of Unicode
2048: "Great news for Maineâwe're once again an independent state!!! Thanks, @unicode, for ruling in our favor and sending troops to end New Hampshire's annexation. ðððï¸"

Impostor Syndrome
It's actually worst in people who study the DunningâKruger effect. We tried to organize a conference on it, but the only people who would agree to give the keynote were random undergrads.

Robots
Don't be nervous about the robots, be nervous about the people with the resources to build them.

Unification
For a while, some physicists worked on a theory unifying the other forces with both the force of gravity and the film "Gravity," but even after Alfonso CuarÃ³n was held in a deep underground chamber of water for 10^31 years he refused to sell his film to Disney.

2018 CVE List
CVE-2018-?????: It turns out Bruce Schneier is just two mischevious kids in a trenchcoat.

Self-Driving Issues
If most people turn into muderers all of a sudden, we'll need to push out a firmware update or something.

The Simpsons
In-universe, Bart Simpson and Harry Potter were the same age in 1990. Bart is perpetually 10 years old because of a spell put on his town by someone trying to keep him from getting his Hogwarts letter.

Code Golf
I also enjoy Reverse Regular Golf. I've been playing for years all across the country and I'm still on the first hole.
